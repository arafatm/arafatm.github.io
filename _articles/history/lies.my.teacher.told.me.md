Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong
James W. Loewen

1. HANDICAPPED BY HISTORY THE PROCESS OF HERO-MAKING
LOCATION: 668

Helen Keller was a radical socialist. She joined the Socialist Party of Massachusetts in 1909.
LOCATION: 720

After the Russian Revolution, she sang the praises of the new communist nation: “In the East a new star is risen!
LOCATION: 722

she helped found the American Civil Liberties Union
LOCATION: 752

Although women did receive the right to vote during Wilson’s administration, the president was at first unsympathetic. He had suffragists arrested; his wife detested them.
LOCATION: 767

Under Wilson, the United States intervened in Latin America more often than at any other time in our history.
LOCATION: 771

In the summer of 1918 he authorized a naval blockade of the Soviet Union and sent expeditionary forces to Murmansk, Archangel, and Vladivostok to help overthrow the Russian Revolution.
LOCATION: 776

democracy never had a chance against his three bedrock “ism”s: colonialism, racism, and anticommunism. A young Ho Chi Minh appealed to Woodrow Wilson at Versailles for self-determination for Vietnam, but Ho had all three strikes against him.
LOCATION: 840

Wilson personally vetoed a clause on racial equality in the Covenant of the League of Nations.
LOCATION: 853

White Americans engaged in a new burst of racial violence during and immediately after Wilson’s presidency. The tone set by the administration was one cause. Another was the release of America’s first epic motion picture.
LOCATION: 873

At a private White House showing, Wilson saw the movie, now retitled Birth of a Nation, and returned Griffith’s compliment: “It is like writing history with lightning, and my only regret is that it is all so true.”
LOCATION: 879

Betsy Ross never did anything. Frisch notes that she played “no role whatsoever in the actual creation of any actual first flag.”
LOCATION: 940

The textbook critic Norma Gabler testified that textbooks should “present our nation’s patriots in a way that would honor and respect them”; in her eyes, admitting Keller’s socialism and Wilson’s racism would hardly do that.
LOCATION: 973

Keller did not want to be frozen in childhood. She herself stressed that the meaning of her life lay in what she did once she overcame her disability.
LOCATION: 982

she was not the first deaf-blind child on record as learning to speak; that honor goes perhaps to Ragnhild Käta, a Norwegian girl whose achievement inspired Keller.
LOCATION: 983

Nor was she the first deaf-blind American to learn to read and write; that was Laura Bridgman, who taught the manual alphabet to Anne Sullivan so Sullivan could teach it to Keller.
LOCATION: 984

the truncated version of Helen Keller’s story sanitizes a hero, leaving only the virtues of self-help and hard work. Keller herself, while scarcely opposing hard work, explicitly rejected this ideology.
LOCATION: 988

I forgot that I owed my success partly to the advantages of my birth and environment. . . . Now, however, I learned that the power to rise in the world is not within the reach of everyone.
LOCATION: 994

“There are three great taboos in textbook publishing,” an editor at one of the biggest houses told me, “sex, religion, and social class.”
LOCATION: 996

Our postwar bipartisan foreign policy, one of far-reaching interventions sheathed in humanitarian explanations, was “shaped decisively by the ideology and the international program developed by the Wilson Administration,”
LOCATION: 1006

We seem to feel that a person like Helen Keller can be an inspiration only so long as she remains uncontroversial, one-dimensional. We don’t want complicated icons.
LOCATION: 1013

“People do not like to think. If one thinks, one must reach conclusions,” Helen Keller pointed out. “Conclusions are not always pleasant.”
LOCATION: 1015

2. 1493 THE TRUE IMPORTANCE OF CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS
LOCATION: 1055

now that Presidents’ Day has combined Washington’s and Lincoln’s birthdays, Columbus is one of only two people the United States honors by name in a national holiday.
LOCATION: 1078

People from other continents had reached the Americas many times before 1492.
LOCATION: 1103

Renaissance was syncretic.
LOCATION: 1122

combined ideas from India (via the Turks), Greece (preserved by Muslim scholars), Arabs, and other cultures to form something new.
LOCATION: 1123

Turks and Moors allowed Jews and Christians freedom of worship at a time when European Christians tortured or expelled Jews and Muslims.
LOCATION: 1142

the Portuguese fleet in 1507 blocked the Red Sea and Persian Gulf to stop trade along the old route, because Portugal controlled the new route, around Africa.
LOCATION: 1143

Around 1400, European rulers began to commission ever bigger guns and learned to mount them on ships. Europe’s incessant wars gave rise to this arms race, which also ushered in refinements in archery, drill, and siege warfare.
LOCATION: 1155

Eventually China, the Ottoman Empire, and other nations in Asia and Africa would fall prey to European arms.
LOCATION: 1156

The Western advantage in military technology is still a burning issue. Nonetheless, not a single textbook mentions arms as a cause of European world domination.
LOCATION: 1163

In the years before Columbus’s voyages, Europe also expanded the use of new forms of social technology—bureaucracy, double-entry
LOCATION: 1165

A third important development was ideological or even theological: amassing wealth and dominating other people came to be positively valued as the key means of winning esteem on earth and salvation in the hereafter.
LOCATION: 1170

in 1495, for instance, Michele de Cuneo wrote about accompanying Columbus on his 1494 expedition into the interior of Haiti: “After we had rested for several days in our settlement, it seemed to the Lord Admiral that it was time to put into execution his desire to search for gold, which was the main reason he had started on so great a voyage full of so many dangers.”
LOCATION: 1175

A fourth factor affecting Europe’s readiness to embrace a “new” continent was the particular nature of European Christianity. Europeans believed in a transportable, proselytizing religion that rationalized conquest.
LOCATION: 1181

Typically, after “discovering” an island and encountering a tribe of American Indians new to them, the Spaniards would read aloud (in Spanish) what came to be called “the Requirement.”
LOCATION: 1183

I implore you to recognize the Church as a lady and in the name of the Pope take the King as lord of this land and obey his mandates. If you do not do it, I tell you that with the help of God I will enter powerfully against you all. I will make war everywhere and every way that I can. I will subject you to the yoke and obedience to the Church and to his majesty. I will take your women and children and make them slaves. . . . The deaths and injuries that you will receive from here on will be your own fault and not that of his majesty nor of the gentlemen that accompany me.
LOCATION: 1186

sixth factor: the diseases Europeans brought with them that aided their conquest.
LOCATION: 1196

New and more deadly forms of smallpox, influenza, and bubonic plague had arisen in Europe
LOCATION: 1196

High school students don’t usually think about the rise of Europe to world domination. It is rarely presented as a question. It seems natural, a given, not something that needs to be explained.
LOCATION: 1200

Deep down, our culture encourages us to imagine that we are richer and more powerful because we’re smarter.
LOCATION: 1202

Also left festering is the notion that “it’s natural” for one group to dominate another.
LOCATION: 1207

Columbus claimed everything he saw right off the boat. When textbooks celebrate this process, they imply that taking the land and dominating the natives were inevitable, if not natural.
LOCATION: 1210

The second expedition was heavily armed. Columbus carefully documented the voyages, including directions, currents, shoals, and descriptions of the residents as ripe for subjugation.
LOCATION: 1213

textbook authors seem unaware that ancient Phoenicians and Egyptians sailed at least as far as Ireland and England, reached Madeira and the Azores, traded with the aboriginal inhabitants of the Canary Islands, and sailed all the way around Africa before 600 BC.
LOCATION: 1221

None of the textbooks credits the Muslims with preserving Greek wisdom, enhancing it with ideas from China, India, and Africa, and then passing on the resulting knowledge to Europe via Spain and Italy.
LOCATION: 1227

Cultures do not evolve in a vacuum; diffusion of ideas is perhaps the most important cause of cultural development. Contact with other cultures often triggers a cultural flowering. Anthropologists call this syncretism: combining ideas from two or more cultures to form something new.
LOCATION: 1233

Ancient Roman and Carthaginian coins keep turning up all over the Americas, causing some archaeologists to conclude that Roman seafarers visited the Americas more than once.
LOCATION: 1245

Native Americans also crossed the Atlantic: anthropologists conjecture that Native Americans voyaged east millennia ago from Canada to Scandinavia or Scotland. Two American Indians shipwrecked in Holland around 60 BC became major curiosities in Europe.
LOCATION: 1247

TABLE 1. EXPLORERS OF AMERICA
LOCATION: 1259

As with the Norse, including the Phoenicians and Africans gives a more complete and complex picture of the past, showing that navigation and exploration did not begin with Europe in the 1400s.
LOCATION: 1319

When Columbus reached Haiti, he found the Arawaks in possession of some spear points made of “guanine.”
LOCATION: 1361

The Arawaks said they got them from black traders who had come from the south and east. Guanine proved to be an alloy of gold, silver, and copper, identical to the gold alloy preferred by West Africans, who also called it “guanine.”
LOCATION: 1361

From contacts in West Africa, the Portuguese heard that African traders were visiting Brazil in the mid-1400s; this knowledge may have influenced Portugal to insist on moving the pope’s “line of demarcation” farther west in the Treaty of Tordesillas (1494).
LOCATION: 1365

Traces of diseases common in Africa have been detected in pre-Columbian corpses in Brazil.
LOCATION: 1367

Columbus’s son Ferdinand, who accompanied the admiral on his third voyage, reports that people they met or heard about in eastern Honduras “are almost black in color, ugly in aspect,” probably Africans.
LOCATION: 1368

The first Europeans to reach Panama—Balboa and company—reported seeing black slaves in an Indian town.
LOCATION: 1369

Oral history from Afro-Mexicans contains tales of pre-Columbian crossings from West Africa.
LOCATION: 1371

Irish legends written in the ninth or tenth century tell of “an abbot and seventeen monks who journeyed to the ‘promised land of the saints’ during
LOCATION: 1374

Columbus didn’t seem to be able to write in Italian, even when writing to people in Genoa. Some historians believe he was Jewish, a converso or convert to Christianity, probably from Spain.
LOCATION: 1402

One textbook tells us he was poor, “the son of a poor Genoese weaver,” while another assures us he was rich, “the son of a prosperous wool-weaver.” Each book is certain, but people who have spent years studying Columbus say we cannot be sure.
LOCATION: 1405

few people on both sides of the Atlantic believed in 1492 that the world was flat. Most Europeans and Native Americans knew the world to be round.
LOCATION: 1424

In 1499 Columbus “reaped” a major gold strike on Haiti. He and his successors then forced hundreds of thousands of Natives to mine the gold for them.
LOCATION: 1456

Columbus died well-off and left his heirs well-endowed, even with the title, “Admiral of the Ocean Sea,” now carried by his eighteenth-generation descendant.
LOCATION: 1458

On his first voyage, Columbus kidnapped some ten to twenty-five American Indians and took them back with him to Spain.55 Only seven or eight arrived alive,
LOCATION: 1521

To ensure cooperation, Columbus used punishment by example. When an Indian committed even a minor offense, the Spanish cut off his ears or nose. Disfigured, the person was sent back to his village as living evidence of the brutality the Spaniards were capable of.
LOCATION: 1531

Spaniards hunted American Indians for sport and murdered them for dog food.
LOCATION: 1558

Estimates of Haiti’s pre-Columbian population range as high as eight million people.
LOCATION: 1587

“By 1516,” according to Benjamin Keen, “thanks to the sinister Indian slave trade and labor policies initiated by Columbus, only some 12,000 remained.”
LOCATION: 1591

Las Casas tells us that fewer than two hundred full-blooded Haitian Indians were alive in 1542. By 1555, they were all gone.
LOCATION: 1592

other nations rushed to emulate Columbus.
LOCATION: 1597

In 1501 the Portuguese began to depopulate Labrador, transporting the now extinct Beothuk Indians to Europe and Cape Verde as slaves.
LOCATION: 1597

After the English established beachheads on the Atlantic coast of North America, they encouraged coastal tribes to capture and sell members of more distant tribes. Charleston, South Carolina, became a major port of exporting American Indian slaves.
LOCATION: 1598

The Pilgrims and Puritans sold the survivors of the Pequot War into slavery in Bermuda in 1637.
LOCATION: 1599

The French shipped virtually the entire Natchez nation in chains to the West Indies in 1731.
LOCATION: 1600

As soon as the 1493 expedition got to the Caribbean, before it even reached Haiti, Columbus was rewarding his lieutenants with native women to rape.
LOCATION: 1611

Columbus wrote a friend in 1500, “A hundred castellanoes are as easily obtained for a woman as for a farm, and it is very general and there are plenty of dealers who go about looking for girls; those from nine to ten are now in demand.”
LOCATION: 1613

Because the Indians died, Indian slavery then led to the massive slave trade the other way across the Atlantic, from Africa.
LOCATION: 1622

This trade also began on Haiti, initiated by Columbus’s son in 1505.
LOCATION: 1623

Predictably, Haiti then became the site of the first large-scale slave revolt, when blacks and American Indians banded together in 1519. The uprising lasted more than a decade and was finally brought to an end by the Spanish in the 1530s.
LOCATION: 1624

In 1499, when Columbus finally found gold on Haiti in significant amounts, Spain became the envy of Europe. After 1500, Portugal, France, Holland, and England joined in conquering the Americas. These nations were at least as brutal as Spain.
LOCATION: 1648

The English, for example, unlike the Spanish, did not colonize by making use of Native labor but simply forced the Indians out of the way. Many American Indians fled English colonies to Spanish territories (Florida, Mexico) in search of more humane treatment.
LOCATION: 1650

Columbus’s voyages caused almost as much change in Europe as in the Americas.
LOCATION: 1653

Crops, animals, ideas, and diseases began to cross the oceans regularly. Perhaps the most far-reaching impact of Columbus’s findings was on European Christianity.
LOCATION: 1653

before America, “Europe was virtually incapable of self-criticism.”80 After America, Europe’s religious uniformity was ruptured.
LOCATION: 1655

American Indians had not rejected Christianity, they had just never encountered it. Were they doomed to hell?
LOCATION: 1658

According to the Bible, at the dawn of creation all animals lived in the Garden of Eden. Later, two of each species entered Noah’s ark and ended up on Mt. Ararat.
LOCATION: 1659

Since Eden and Mt. Ararat were both in the Middle East, where could these new American species have come from?
LOCATION: 1660

Such questions shook orthodox Catholicism and contributed to the Protestant Reformation, which began in 1517.
LOCATION: 1661

Europe’s fascination with the Americas was directly responsible, in fact, for a rise in European self-consciousness.
LOCATION: 1672

there was no “Europe” before 1492. People were simply Tuscan, French, and the like. Now Europeans began to see similarities among themselves,
LOCATION: 1674

there were no “white” people in Europe before 1492. With the transatlantic slave trade, first Indian, then African, Europeans increasingly saw “white” as a race and race as an important human characteristic.
LOCATION: 1675

The Americas affected more than the mind. African and Eurasian stomachs were also affected. Almost half of all major crops now grown throughout the world originally came from the Americas.
LOCATION: 1690

According to Alfred Crosby Jr., adding corn to African diets caused the population to grow, which helped fuel the African slave trade to the Americas.
LOCATION: 1691

Adding potatoes to European diets caused the population to explode in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, which in turn helped fuel the European emigration to the Americas and Australia.
LOCATION: 1692

Columbus’s gold finds on Haiti were soon dwarfed by discoveries of gold and silver in Mexico and the Andes.
LOCATION: 1699

Marx and Engels held that this wealth “gave to commerce, to navigation, to industry an impulse never before known.”
LOCATION: 1702

Gold and silver from America replaced land as the basis for wealth and status, increasing the power of the new merchant class
LOCATION: 1704

American gold and silver fueled a 400 percent inflation that eroded the economies of most non-European countries
LOCATION: 1706

Africa suffered: the trans-Saharan trade collapsed, because the Americas supplied more gold and silver than the Gold Coast ever could. African traders now had only one commodity that Europe wanted: slaves.
LOCATION: 1707

“No sensible Indian person,” wrote George P. Horse Capture, “can celebrate the arrival of Columbus.”90 Cherishing Columbus is a characteristic of white history, not American history.
LOCATION: 1727

the Columbus myth “allows us to accept the contemporary division of the world into developed and underdeveloped spheres as natural and given, rather than a historical product issuing from a process that began with Columbus’s first voyage.”
LOCATION: 1735

We understand Columbus and all European explorers and settlers more clearly if we treat 1492 as a meeting of three cultures (Africa was soon involved), rather than a discovery by one,
LOCATION: 1738

In 1823 Chief Justice John Marshall of the U.S. Supreme Court decreed that Cherokees had certain rights to their land in Georgia by dint of their “occupancy” but that whites had superior rights owing to their “discovery.”
LOCATION: 1748

On Christmas Day 1492, Columbus needed help. Santa Maria ran aground off Haiti. Columbus sent for help to the nearest Arawak town, and “all the people of the town” responded, “with very big and many canoes.”
LOCATION: 1753

On his final voyage Columbus shipwrecked on Jamaica, and the Arawaks there kept him and his crew of more than a hundred alive for a whole year until Spaniards from Haiti rescued them.
LOCATION: 1757

Native Americans cured Cartier’s men of scurvy near Montreal in 1535.
LOCATION: 1760

They repaired Francis Drake’s Golden Hind in California so he could complete his round-the-world voyage in 1579.
LOCATION: 1761

Lewis and Clark’s expedition to the Pacific Northwest was made possible by tribe after tribe of American Indians, with help from two Shoshone guides, Sacagawea and Toby, who served as interpreters.
LOCATION: 1762

When Admiral Peary discovered the North Pole, the first person there was probably neither the European American Peary nor the African American Matthew Henson, his assistant, but their four Inuit guides, men and women on whom the entire expedition relied.
LOCATION: 1763

Our histories fail to mention such assistance. They portray proud Western conquerors bestriding the world like the Colossus at Rhodes.
LOCATION: 1765

So long as our textbooks hide from us the roles that people of color have played in exploration, from at least 6000 BC to the twentieth century, they encourage us to look to Europe and its extensions as the seat of all knowledge and intelligence.
LOCATION: 1766

So long as they say “discover,” they imply that whites are the only people who really matter.
LOCATION: 1768

So long as they simply celebrate Columbus, rather than teach both sides of his exploit, they encourage us to identify with white Western exploitation rather than study it.
LOCATION: 1769

Of course, this new history must not judge Columbus by standards from our own time. In 1493 the world had not decided, for instance, that slavery was wrong.
LOCATION: 1808

However, some Spaniards of the time—Bartolomé de Las Casas, for example—opposed the slavery, land-grabbing, and forced labor that Columbus introduced on Haiti.
LOCATION: 1811

Las Casas denounced it as “among the most unpardonable offenses ever committed against God and mankind.” He helped prompt Spain to enact laws against American Indian slavery.99 Although these laws came too late to help the Arawaks and were often disregarded,
LOCATION: 1815

Simon Bolívar used Las Casas’s writings to justify the revolutions between 1810 and 1830 that liberated Latin America from Spanish domination.
LOCATION: 1818

When they leave out Las Casas, they omit an interesting idealist with whom we all might identify. When they glorify Columbus, our textbooks prod us toward identifying with the oppressor.
LOCATION: 1822

When textbook authors omit the causes and process of European world domination, they offer us a history whose purpose must be to keep us unaware of the important questions.
LOCATION: 1823

3. THE TRUTH ABOUT THE FIRST THANKSGIVING
LOCATION: 1827

“Settlers” were white, a student once pointed out to me. “Indians” didn’t settle.
LOCATION: 1853

The first non-Native settlers in “the country we now know as the United States” were African slaves left in South Carolina in 1526 by Spaniards who abandoned a settlement attempt.
LOCATION: 1858

Spanish Jews, who settled in New Mexico in the late 1500s.
LOCATION: 1862

Few Americans know that one-third of the United States, from San Francisco to Arkansas to Natchez to Florida, has been Spanish longer than it has been “American,” and that Hispanic Americans lived here before the first ancestor of the Daughters of the American Revolution ever left England.
LOCATION: 1863

Spanish culture left an indelible mark on the American West. The Spanish introduced horses, cattle, sheep, pigs, and the basic elements of cowboy culture, including its vocabulary: mustang, bronco, rodeo, lariat, and so on.
LOCATION: 1865

Beginning the story in 1620 also omits the Dutch, who were living in what is now Albany by 1614.
LOCATION: 1879

The mythic origin of “the country we now know as the United States” is at Plymouth Rock, and the year is 1620.
LOCATION: 1881

the Black (or bubonic) Plague “was undoubtedly the worst disaster that has ever befallen mankind.”10 In the years 1348 through 1350, it killed perhaps 30 percent of the population of Europe.
LOCATION: 1893

The warmer parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa have historically been the breeding ground for most human illnesses.
LOCATION: 1900

Microbes that live outside their human hosts during part of their life cycle had trouble coping with northern Europe and Asia.
LOCATION: 1902

When people migrated to the Americas across the newly drained Bering Strait, if the archaeological consensus is correct, the changes in climate and physical circumstance threatened even those hardy parasites that had survived the earlier slow migration northward from Africa.
LOCATION: 1904

These first immigrants entered the Americas through a frigid decontamination chamber.
LOCATION: 1905

People in the Western Hemisphere had no cows, pigs, horses, sheep, goats, or chickens before the arrival of Europeans and Africans after 1492.
LOCATION: 1909

Many diseases—from anthrax to tuberculosis, cholera to streptococcus, ringworm to various poxes—are passed back and forth between humans and livestock.
LOCATION: 1909

Europe and Asia were also made unhealthy by a subtler factor: social density.
LOCATION: 1912

Organisms that cause disease need a constant supply of new hosts for their own survival.
LOCATION: 1913

most of the Western Hemisphere lacked the social density found in much of Europe, Africa, and Asia. And nowhere in the Western Hemisphere were there sinkholes of sickness like London or Cairo, with raw sewage running in the streets.
LOCATION: 1925

The scarcity of disease in the Americas was also partly attributable to the basic hygiene practiced by the region’s inhabitants.
LOCATION: 1927

Residents of northern Europe and England rarely bathed, believing it unhealthy,
LOCATION: 1928

The Pilgrims smelled bad to the Indians.
LOCATION: 1929

Squanto “tried, without success, to teach them to bathe,” according to Feenie Ziner, his biographer.
LOCATION: 1930

Ironically, their very health proved their undoing, for they had built up no resistance, genetically or through childhood diseases, to the microbes that Europeans and Africans would bring to them.
LOCATION: 1933

In 1617, just before the Pilgrims landed, a pandemic swept southern New England.
LOCATION: 1935

For decades, English and French fishermen had fished off the Massachusetts coast.
LOCATION: 1935

The plague that ensued made the Black Death pale by comparison.
LOCATION: 1938

Within three years the plague wiped out between 90 to 96 percent of the inhabitants of coastal New England.
LOCATION: 1940

During the next fifteen years, additional epidemics, most of which we know to have been smallpox, struck repeatedly.
LOCATION: 1957

The impact of the epidemics on the two cultures was profound. The English Separatists, already seeing their lives as part of a divinely inspired morality play, found it easy to infer that God was on their side. John Winthrop, governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, called the plague “miraculous.”
LOCATION: 1959

Many Natives likewise inferred that their god had abandoned them.
LOCATION: 1965

Their net result was that the English, for their first fifty years in New England, would face no real Indian challenge.
LOCATION: 1972

Historian Karen Kupperman speculates:
LOCATION: 1981

The technology and culture of Indians on America’s east coast were genuine rivals to those of the English, and the eventual outcome of the rivalry was not at first clear. . . . One can only speculate what the outcome of the rivalry would have been if the impact of European diseases on the American population had not been so devastating. If colonists had not been able to occupy lands already cleared by Indian farmers who had vanished, colonization would have proceeded much more slowly. If Indian culture had not been devastated by the physical and psychological assaults it had suffered, colonization might not have proceeded at all.
LOCATION: 1982

A century and a half after Hernando de Soto traveled the southeastern United States, French explorers there found the population less than a quarter of what it had been when de Soto had passed through,
LOCATION: 1993

Likewise, on their famous 1804–06 expedition, Lewis and Clark encountered far more Natives in Oregon than lived there a mere twenty years later.
LOCATION: 1995

When the Spanish marched into Tenochtitlan, there were so many bodies that they had to walk on them. Most of the Spaniards were immune to the disease, and that fact itself helped to crush Aztec morale.
LOCATION: 2003

The pestilence continues today. Miners and loggers recently introduced European diseases to the Yanomamos of northern Brazil and southern Venezuela, killing a fourth of their total population in 1991 alone.
LOCATION: 2005

Europeans were never able to “settle” China, India, Indonesia, Japan, or much of Africa, because too many people already lived there.
LOCATION: 2008

William McNeill reckons the population of the Americas at one hundred million in 1492, while William Langer suggests that Europe had only about seventy million people when Columbus set forth.
LOCATION: 2010

Most current estimates of the precontact population of the United States and Canada range from ten to twenty million.
LOCATION: 2044

(Never mind that tiny San Marino may have formed as a republic in AD 301, Iceland became a republic in 930, and Switzerland around 1300.)
LOCATION: 2128

textbooks underplay Jamestown and the sixteenth-century Spanish settlements in favor of Plymouth Rock as the archetypal birthplace of the United States.
LOCATION: 2133

The Virginians’ relations with American Indians were particularly unsavory:
LOCATION: 2138

the English in Virginia took Indian prisoners and forced them to teach colonists how to farm.
LOCATION: 2139

The English offered a toast “symbolizing eternal friendship,” whereupon the chief, his family, advisors, and two hundred followers dropped dead of poison.
LOCATION: 2141

the early Virginians engaged in bickering, sloth, even cannibalism. They spent their early days digging random holes in the ground, haplessly looking for gold instead of planting crops.
LOCATION: 2142

Soon they were starving and digging up putrid Native corpses to eat or renting themselves out to American Indian families as servants
LOCATION: 2143

neither our culture nor our textbooks give Virginia the same archetypal status as Massachusetts.
LOCATION: 2149

Despite having ended up many miles from other European enclaves, the Pilgrims hardly “started from scratch” in a “wilderness.” Throughout southern New England, Native Americans had repeatedly burned the underbrush, creating a parklike environment.
LOCATION: 2152

They chose Plymouth because of its beautiful cleared fields, recently planted in corn, and its useful harbor and “brook of fresh water.”
LOCATION: 2155

In 1927 an organization of Native leaders called the Grand Council Fire of American Indians criticized textbooks as “unjust to the life of our people.” They went on to ask, “What is civilization?

Although it is a complicated historical issue, racism in the Western world stems primarily from two related historical processes: taking land from and destroying indigenous peoples and enslaving Africans to work that land.

Between 1890 and 1907 every Southern and border state “legally” disenfranchised the vast majority of its African American voters. Lynchings rose to an all-time high. In 1896 the Supreme Court upheld segregation in Plessy v. Ferguson.

Only Boorstin and Kelley gets Brown right: “The problem, of course, was that there really could never be such a thing as ‘separate but equal’ facilities for the two races. When any race was kept apart from another, it was deprived of its equality—which meant its right to be treated like all other citizens.”
LOCATION: 3757

Textbooks need to offer the sociological definition of segregation: a system of racial etiquette that keeps the oppressed group separate from the oppressor when both are doing equal tasks, like learning the multiplication tables, but allows intimate closeness when the tasks are hierarchical, like cooking or cleaning for white employers.

This stigma is why separate could never mean equal, even when black facilities might be newer or physically superior.

Theatrical productions of Uncle Tom’s Cabin played throughout the nadir, but since the novel’s indictment of slavery was no longer congenial to an increasingly racist white society, rewrites changed Uncle Tom from a martyr who gave his life to protect his people into a sentimental dope who was loyal to kindly masters.
LOCATION: 3780

In the black community, Uncle Tom eventually came to mean an African American without integrity who sells out his people’s interests.

6. JOHN BROWN AND ABRAHAM LINCOLN THE INVISIBILITY OF ANTIRACISM IN AMERICAN HISTORY TEXTBOOKS
LOCATION: 3922

In the eighteen textbooks I reviewed, Brown makes two appearances: Pottawatomie, Kansas, and Harpers Ferry, Virginia.
LOCATION: 3962

Recall that the 1854 Kansas-Nebraska Act tried to resolve the question of slavery through “popular sovereignty.”
LOCATION: 3963

Northerners rushed to live and farm in Kansas Territory and make it “free soil.”
LOCATION: 3965

Fewer Southern planters moved to Kansas with their slaves, but slave owners from Missouri repeatedly crossed the Missouri River to vote in territorial elections and to establish a reign of terror
LOCATION: 3965

In May 1856 hundreds of pro-slavery “border ruffians,” as they came to be called, raided the free-soil town of Lawrence, Kansas, killing two people, burning down the hotel, and destroying two printing presses.
LOCATION: 3967

An older textbook, The American Tradition, describes Brown’s action at Pottawatomie flatly: “In retaliation, a militant abolitionist named John Brown led a midnight attack on the proslavery settlement of Pottawatomie. Five people were killed by Brown and his followers.”
LOCATION: 3969

he had moved to the Adirondacks, hoping his sons would join him there, but five sons and their families instead went to Kansas, hoping to farm in peace. They then asked their father for aid when threatened by their pro-slavery neighbors.

Thoreau went on to compare Brown with Jesus of Nazareth, who had faced a similar death at the hands of the state.

Not until the civil rights movement of the 1960s was white America freed from enough of its racism to accept that a white person did not have to be crazy to die for black equality.

Brown never believed God commanded him in the sense of giving him instructions; rather, he thought deeply about the moral meaning of Christianity and decided that slavery was incompatible with it.

If I could save the Union without freeing any slave, I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves, I would do it;

He was speaking not to Greeley, who wanted slavery to end, but to antiwar Democrats and antiblack Irish Americans, as well as to governors of the border states and the many other Northerners who opposed emancipating the slaves.

Throughout the twentieth century, textbooks presented the Civil War as a struggle between “virtually identical peoples.” This is all part of the unspoken agreement, reached during the nadir of race relations in the United States (1890–1940), that whites in the South were as American as whites in the North.

In Iraq, our body armor, medical care, etc., have been much better than previously. As a result, the ratio of combat deaths to wounded is far lower—about 1 to 9, while in Vietnam it was 1 to 3. It is splendid that fewer soldiers are dying. Since many more are wounded, however, some severely, like this man, deaths no longer tell the full story.

The death toll shrinks further because many war services, like driving and guarding truck convoys, have been contracted out to private companies, whose losses are omitted from official statistics.

Iraqi deaths—far more numerous than our own—also don’t figure in the totals. Yet the death toll forms our main knowledge of a war’s cost, since most of us make no personal sacrifice.

12. WHY IS HISTORY TAUGHT LIKE THIS?
LOCATION: 6544

Until World War II, history, much more than the other social sciences, was overtly anti-Semitic and antiblack.
LOCATION: 6596

According to Peter Novick, whose book That Noble Dream is the best recent account of the history profession, looking at every white college and university in America, exactly one black was ever employed to teach history before 1945.
LOCATION: 6597

Most historians were males from privileged white families. They wrote with blinders on.

according to comparative historian Marc Ferro, the United States has wound up with the largest gap of any country in the world between what historians know and what the rest of us are taught.

To maintain a stratified system, it is terribly important to control how people think about that system. Marx advanced this analysis under the rubric false consciousness.

Rich capitalists control the major TV networks, most newspapers, and all textbook-publishing companies, and thus possess immense power to frame the way we talk and think about current events.

The most popular revamped theory asserts that since working-class young men bore the real cost of the war, “naturally” they and their families opposed it.
LOCATION: 7552

it reduces the thinking of the working class to a crude personal cost-benefit analysis, implicitly denying that the less educated might take society as a whole into consideration.
LOCATION: 7554

It is also wrong.
LOCATION: 7557

Working-class young men who enlisted or looked forward to being drafted could not easily influence their destinies to avoid Vietnam, but they could change their attitudes about the war to be more positive.

Thus, cognitive dissonance helps explain why young men of draft age supported the war more than older men, and why men supported the war more than women.

Two social processes, each tied to schooling, can account for educated Americans’ support of the Vietnam War.
LOCATION: 7564

The first can be summarized by the term allegiance. Educated adults tend to be successful and earn high incomes
LOCATION: 7564

parents transmit affluence and education directly to their children. Successful Americans do not usually lay their success at their parents’ doorstep,
LOCATION: 7566

Believing that American society is open to individual input, the educated well-to-do tend to agree with society’s decisions and feel they had a hand in forming them.
LOCATION: 7569

We can use the term vested interest here, so long as we realize we are referring to an ideological interest or need, a need to come to terms with the privilege with which one has been blessed, not simple economic self-interest.
LOCATION: 7570

those in the upper third of our educational and income structure are more likely to show allegiance to society, while those in the lower third are more likely to be critical of it.
LOCATION: 7573

The other process causing educated adults to be more likely to support the Vietnam War can be summarized under the rubric socialization.
LOCATION: 7575

Education as socialization tells people what to think and how to act and requires them to conform.
LOCATION: 7581

Education as socialization influences students simply to accept the rightness of our society.
LOCATION: 7582

Both the allegiance and socialization processes cause the educated to believe that what America does is right.

In late spring 1966, just before the United States began bombing Hanoi and Haiphong in North Vietnam, Americans split 50-50 as to whether we should bomb these targets. After the bombing began, 85 percent favored the bombing while only 15 percent opposed.
LOCATION: 7585

The sudden shift was the result, not the cause, of the government’s decision to bomb.
LOCATION: 7587

In 1968, war sentiment was waning; but 51 percent of Americans opposed a bombing halt, partly because the United States was still bombing North Vietnam. A month later, after President Johnson announced a bombing halt, 71 percent favored the halt.

This swaying of thought by policy affects attitudes on issues ranging from our space program to environmental policy and shows the so-called “silent majority” to be an unthinking majority as well.
