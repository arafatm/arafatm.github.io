title: Easy check-in questions for your 1:1s

Here are the questions I've been asking in coaching calls with managers and
individual contributors alike, to get a gut check on how folks are feeling
during this awful, strange season—without making the conversation too heavy.

### What's been working for you so far?

### What's been hardest?

(Or: what's been the most surprising thing?)

### What's your north star right now?

(Or: what are you optimizing for during this unusual time?)

### If you're talking to a manager or leader: What feedback have you gotten on your leadership during this time?

### What's one thing you want to experiment with right now?

## And here are some tips on how to ask these questions, straight from the brilliant mind of Paloma Medina:

### Ask them to expand on their answer so you can understand their underlying core needs: 

If they say “I am really worried about this deadline!” ask them to
expand: “Oh, say more about that...” or “Ah, which part do you think is the
most likely to lead to that?”

### ALWAYS confirm with them if your inference is correct: 

For example, “So, if you and I checked in more frequently over Slack, you would feel better about this, did I get that right?”
