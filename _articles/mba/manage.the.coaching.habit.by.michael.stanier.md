## Intro

You’re probably not getting very effective coaching; 

and you’re probably not delivering very effective coaching.

When you build a coaching habit, you can more easily break out of three vicious circles

Circle :one: Creating Overdependence
- The more you help your people, the more they seem to need your help.
- help your team be more self-sufficient by increasing their autonomy and sense
  of mastery and by reducing your need to jump in,

Circle :two: Getting Overwhelmed
- The more overwhelmed you feel, the more you lose focus.

Circle :three: Becoming Disconnected
- You have to help people do more of the work that has impact and meaning.
- The more we do work that has no real purpose, the less engaged and motivated we are.

You’re up against **the Bind, the Grind and the Resigned**.

## How to Build a Habit 

*In which we unpack the real science of how to change your behaviour, rather
than relying on the myths and lies that you’ll find on the Internet.*

The change of behaviour at the heart of what this book is about is this: a
little more asking people questions and a little less telling people what to
do.

Duke University study says that at least *45 percent of our waking behaviour is
habitual*.

To build an effective new habit, you need five essential components: 
- a reason,
- a trigger, 
- a micro-habit, 
- an effective practice, 
- a plan.

### Make a Vow

Research shows that if you spend too much time imagining the outcome, you’re
less motivated to actually do the work to get there.

Zen Habits: Mastering the Art of Change.

think less about what your habit can do for you, and more about how this new
habit will help a person or people you care about.

### Figure Your Trigger

The more specific you can be when defining your trigger moment, the more useful
a piece of data it is.
- **"At the team meeting"**
- **"When I’m asked to check in at the team meeting"**
- **"When Jenny asks me for feedback on her idea in the team meeting."**

### Double-S It: Be Short & Specific

define your new habit as a micro-habit that needs to take less than sixty
seconds to complete.

It’s about getting really clear on the first step or two

### Practice Deeply

three components of Deep Practice
- Practicing small chunks of the bigger action
- Repetition, repetition and repetition… and repetition.
- being mindful and noticing when it goes well.

### Plan How to Get Back on Track

face the reality that we will not achieve perfection in our quest to build the
habit.

We will miss a moment, miss a day.  What you need to know is what to do when that happens.

Resilient systems build in fail-safes so that when something breaks down, the
next step to recover is obvious.

### Put It All Together: The New Habit Formula

three parts to the formula: 
- identifying the trigger, 
- identifying the old habit 
- defining the new behaviour.

Identifying the Trigger: **When This Happens...** 

Five types of triggers: 
- location, 
- time, 
- emotional state, 
- other people, 
- the immediately preceding action.

Identifying the Old Habit: **Instead Of ...**

Articulate the old habit, so you know what you’re trying to stop doing.

Defining the New Behaviour: **I Will...**

Define the new behaviour, one that will take **sixty seconds or less** to do.

A Final Word on Building Your Coaching Habit: This stuff is simple, but it’s not easy.

To counter that resistance,
```
Start somewhere easy.
Start small.
Buddy up.
```

The habit will slip. It won’t always work.

through deliberate and regular practice that you’ll move to **conscious competence**

## Question Masterclass Part 1: Ask One Question at a Time

*Ask one question at a time. Just one question at a time.*

New Habit WHEN THIS HAPPENS… After I’ve asked a question… 

INSTEAD OF… Adding another question. And then maybe another question, and then another, because after all, they’re all good questions and I’m really curious as to what their answers are… 

I WILL… Ask just one question. (And then be quiet while I wait for the answer.)

## 1: The Kickstart Question: "What's on your mind?" 

*In which you discover the power of an opening question that gets the
conversation happening fast and deep.*

If you’ve ever felt stuck in a conversation, one of these three situations
might be at play: 
- the Small Talk Tango, 
- the Ossified Agenda, 
- the Default Diagnosis.

**The Small Talk Tango**: Small talk might be a useful way to warm up, but it’s
rarely the bridge that leads to a conversation that matters.

**The Ossified Agenda**: commonly found in standing meetings—same time, same
people, same place, same agenda. Dreary recitation of facts and figures. It’s
putting process in front of what really matters.

**The Default Diagnosis**: There’s no question or conversation about what the
issue is. You’re sure you know what it is. Or they’re sure they know what it
is.

> Digging faster or smarter isn’t going to help.

### The Kickstart Question: What’s on Your Mind?"

*Fail-safe way to start a chat*

It’s encouragement to go right away to what’s exciting, what’s provoking
anxiety. Let’s talk about the thing that matters most.

**Coaching for Performance vs. Coaching for Development**

Coaching for performance is about addressing and fixing a specific problem or
challenge.

Coaching for development is about turning the focus from the issue to the
person dealing with the issue, the person who’s managing the fire.

Deepen Focus with the 3Ps
- Projects: the content of the situation,
- People: When you’re talking about people, though, you’re not really talking
  about them. You’re talking about a relationship and, specifically, about what
  your role is in this relationship that might currently be less than ideal.
- Patterns: of behaviour and ways of working that you’d like to change.

```
"So there are three different facets of that we could look at," you offer.
"The project side—any challenges around the actual content. The people side—any
issues with team members/colleagues/other departments/bosses/customers/clients.
And patterns—if there’s a way that you’re getting in your own way, and not
showing up in the best possible way.  Where should we start?"
```

When they’re done discussing that P, you can just take them to one of the other
two Ps and ask, **"If this was a thing, what would the challenge here be for
you?"**

- TODO TheCoachingHabit.com/videos: STARTING STRONG "What’s on your mind?"

what you’re holding in your mind will unconsciously influence what you can
notice and focus on. When you’re thinking of buying a red Mazda, you suddenly
start noticing all the red Mazdas on the road.

## Question Masterclass Part 2 Cut the Intro and Ask the Question

Here’s Your New Habit 

WHEN THIS HAPPENS… When I’ve got a question to ask… 

INSTEAD OF… Setting it up, framing it, explaining it, warming up to it and
generally taking forever to get to the moment… 

I WILL… Ask the question. (And then shut up to listen to the answer.)

## 2: The AWE Question: "And What Else?"

*In which the Best Coaching Question in the World is revealed and you marvel at
the power of three short words.*

**Tell less and ask more**. Your advice is not as good As you think it is.

The Advice Monster leaps out of the darkness and hijacks the conversation.
Before you realize what’s happening, your mind is turned towards finding The
Answer and you’re leaping in to offer ideas,

Even though we don’t really know what the issue is, or what’s going on for the
person, we’re quite sure we’ve got the answer she needs.

**"And what else?"** breaks that cycle. When asking it becomes a habit, it’s often
the simplest way to stay lazy and stay curious.

Four Practical Tips for Asking **"And What Else?"**
- Stay Curious, Stay Genuine
- Ask It One More Time. I typically ask it at least three times, and rarely
  more than five.
- Recognize Success. Someone’s going to say to you, **"There is nothing else."**
  Move On When It’s Time

A strong "wrap it up" variation of "And what else?" is **"Is there anything else?"**

**The Paradox of Choice**: generally assumed that four is actually the ideal
number at which we can chunk information. 

**"And what else?"** is such a useful question that you can add it into almost
every exchange.

- TODO TheCoachingHabit.com/videos to THE ONE QUESTION THAT RULES THEM ALL

## Question Masterclass Part 3 Should You Ask Rhetorical Questions?

*Stop offering up advice with a question mark attached. That doesn’t count as
asking a question. If you’ve got an idea, wait. Ask, "And what else?"*

Here’s Your New Habit 

WHEN THIS HAPPENS… I’ve got the answer, which I want to suggest… 

INSTEAD OF… Asking a fake question such as "Have you thought of…?" or "What
about…?" which is just advice with a question mark attached… 

I WILL… Ask one of the Seven Essential Questions. And if I want to present an
idea, I’ll offer it up as an option rather than a question.

## 3: The Focus Question: "What’s the Real Challenge Here for You?"

*In which you find out how to stop spending so much time and effort solving the
wrong problem.*

When people start talking to you about the challenge at hand, what’s essential
to remember is that what they’re laying out for you is rarely the actual
problem.

And when you start jumping in to fix things, things go off the rails in three
ways: you work on the wrong problem; you do the work your team should be doing;
and the work doesn’t get done.

This is the question that will help slow down the rush to action, so you spend
time solving the real problem, not just the first problem.

What’s the challenge? Curiosity is taking you in the right direction, but
phrased like this the question is too vague.

What’s the real challenge here? Implied here is that there are a number of
challenges to choose from, and you have to find the one that matters most.

What’s the real challenge here for you? It’s too easy for people to pontificate
about the high-level or abstract challenges in a situation.

**Focus on the real problem, not the first problem.**

Instead of moving into advice-giving, solution-providing mode, you ask the
Focus Question: **"What’s the real challenge here for you?"**

A solid forty-five minutes (in a 1:1) talking about John (a coworker). And no
doubt it’s a thoroughly entertaining. You bonded deeply.  This, however, is not
coaching. Or managing. It’s gossiping. Or, more bluntly, bitching and moaning.

Three Strategies to Make This Question Work for You
- Trust That You’re Being Useful: Learn to recognize the moment when you ask
  the question and there’s a pause, a heartbeat of silence when you can see the
  person actually thinking and figuring out the answer.
- Remember That There Is a Place for Your Advice: When someone pops his head
  around the door and asks, **"Do you know where the folder is?"** tell him
  where the folder is. Don’t ask,
- Remember the Second Question
  - Asking, **"What’s the real challenge here for you?"** Good.
  - Adding, **"And what else? What else is a real challenge here for you?"** Even better.

One of your roles as a manager and a leader is to have answers. We’re just
trying to slow down the rush to this role as your default behaviour.

- TODO TheCoachingHabit.com/videos HOW TO HELP YOUR TEAM FIND FOCUS

In Barry Schwartz’s The Paradox of Choice, multiple studies that show how
limiting choices reduces overwhelm and polychronicity,

Part of what makes the Focus Question work so well are those two final words,
**"for you."**

researchers found that when the word **"you"** was present, the questions needed to
be repeated fewer times, and the problems were solved in a shorter amount of
time and with more accuracy.

## Question Masterclass Part 4 Stick to Questions Starting with "What"

Yes, there’s a place for asking "Why?"

**It’s not while you’re in a focused conversation**

Two good reasons:
- *You put them on the defensive*. Get the tone even slightly wrong and
  suddenly your "Why… ?" come across as "What the hell were you thinking?" It’s
  only downhill from there.
- *You’re trying to solve the problem*. You ask why because you want more
  detail.  You want more detail because you want to fix the problem. And
  suddenly you’re back in the vicious circles of overdependence and overwhelm.

**Stick to questions starting with "What" and avoid questions starting with
"Why."**

An Irresistible 1-2-3 Combination: The first three questions can combine to
become a robust script for your coaching conversation.
- Open with: **What’s on your mind?** The perfect way to start; the question is
  open but focused.
- Check in: **Is there anything else on your mind?** Give the person an option
  to share additional concerns.
- Then begin to focus: **So what’s the real challenge here for you?** Already
  the conversation will deepen. Your job now is to find what’s most useful to
  look at.
- Ask: **And what else (is the real challenge here for you)?** Trust me, the
  person will have something. And there may be more.
- Probe again: **Is there anything else?** You’ll have most of what matters in
  front of you now.

So get to the heart of it and ask: So... what’s the real challenge here for
you?

## 4 The Foundation Question: "What Do You Want?"

*In which the question that lies at the very heart of adult-to-adult
relationships is discussed.*

Peter Block
- TODO book Flawless Consulting
- TODO Book: The Answer to How Is Yes. 

We often don’t know what we actually want.

> "The single biggest problem with communication is the illusion that it has
> taken place." -- George Bernard Shaw 

One of the ways to ensure smoother sailing is to **understand the difference
between wants and needs**.

Want: I’d like to have this. 

Need: I must have this.

Marshall Rosenberg is the creator of Nonviolent Communication (NVC). In
Rosenberg’s model, wants are the surface requests, the tactical outcomes we’d
like from a situation.

Rosenberberg says there are nine self-explanatory universal needs.

    | Affection     | Creation   | Recreation    |
    | Freedom       | Identity   | Understanding |
    | Participation | Protection | Subsistence   |

When you ask someone, **"What do you want?"** listen to see if you can guess the
need that likely lies behind the person’s request.

    The fundamental organizing principle of the brain is the risk-and-reward
    response -- Neuroscientist Evan Gordon

Five times a second, at an unconscious level, your brain is scanning the
environment around you and asking itself: Is it safe here? Or is it dangerous?

When the brain senses danger, **"amygdala hijack."**

We’re biased to assume that situations are dangerous rather than not.  

TERA: influences how the brain reads any situation.
- T is for tribe. The brain is asking, "Are you with me, or are you against
  me?"
- E is for expectation. The brain is figuring out, "Do I know the future or
  don’t I?"
- R is for rank. It’s a relative thing, and it depends not on your formal title
  but on how power is being played out in the moment. "Are you more important
  or less important than I am?" 
- A is for autonomy. Dan Pink talks about the importance of this in his
  excellent book Drive. "Do I get a say or don’t I?" That’s

**Increase the TERA Quotient whenever you can.**

Asking questions in general, and asking **"What do you want?"** specifically, will
do that.

It increases the sense of tribe-iness, rather than dictating, or helping him
solve a challenge.

- TODO TheCoachingHabit.com/videos THE TERA QUOTIENT

From the school of therapy known as "solution-based" therapy. They have a go-to question
called the miracle question.

    "Suppose that tonight, while you’re sleeping, a miracle happens. When you
    get up in the morning tomorrow, how will you know that things have suddenly
    got better?"

More courageously imagine what better (and much better) really looks like. **A
10x improvement, not a 10 percent tweak**.

## Question Masterclass Part 5 Get Comfortable with Silence

When you ask someone one of the Seven Essential Questions, sometimes what follows is silence.

> Silence is often a measure of success.

Means he’s thinking, searching for the answer.

Bite your tongue, and don’t fill the silence

Here’s Your New Habit 

WHEN THIS HAPPENS… When I’ve asked a question and she doesn’t have an answer
ready within the first two seconds… 

INSTEAD OF… Filling up the space with another question or the same question
just asked a new way or a suggestion or just pointless words… 

I WILL… Take a breath, stay open and keep quiet for another three seconds.

## 5: The Lazy Question: "What do you want from me (out of curiosity)?" 

*In which you discover the question that will make you more useful to those you
manage, while working less hard, and you decide that being lazy is a good thing
after all*.

Insight that when you offer to help someone, you "one up" yourself: you raise
your status and you lower hers, whether you mean to or not.

The *Karpman Drama Triangle* starts by assuming that, at least some of the
time, we’re playing less-than-fantastic versions of ourselves with most of the
people with whom we interact.

We’re bouncing around between three archetypal roles: **Victim, Persecutor and
Rescuer**, each one as unhelpful and dysfunctional as the other.

Victim
- You have no responsibility for fixing anything; you get to complain; you
  attract Rescuers.
- You’re known to be ineffective. And no one likes a whiner.

Persecutor
- You feel superior and have a sense of power and control.
- You end up being responsible for everything. You create Victims. You’re known
  as a micromanager.
- People do the minimum for you and no more. And no one likes a bully.

Rescuer
- You feel morally superior; you believe you’re indispensable.
- People reject your help. You create Victims and perpetuate the Drama
  Triangle. And no one likes a meddler.

We tend to have a favourite role that we default to most of the time.

> "The minute we begin to think we have all the answers, we forget the questions" --  Madeleine L’Engle

> "Go on failing. Go on. Only next time, try to fail better." --  Samuel Beckett

**Be Blunt...**

The more direct version of How can I help?" is **"What do you want from me?"**
- **"Out of curiosity"**

**"What do you think I should do about…?"** is the cheddar on the mousetrap.

Say, **"That’s a great question. I’ve got some ideas, which I’ll share with
you. But before I do, what are your first thoughts?"**

**"That’s terrific. What else could you do?"**

**"This is all good. Is there anything else you could try here?"**

If the conversation is going well, keep asking **"And what else?"** until she has run out of ideas.

- TODO TheCoachingHabit.com/videos How to Be More Helpful (Rather Than **"Helpful"**)

## Question Masterclass Part 6 Actually Listen to the Answer

One of the most compelling things you can do after asking a question is to
genuinely listen to the answer. **Stay curious**, my friend.

Here’s Your New Habit 

WHEN THIS HAPPENS… After I’ve asked a question… 

INSTEAD OF… Going through the motions of looking like I’m actively listening… 

I WILL… Actually listen. And when I get distracted (which I will), I’ll come
back and start listening again.

## 6: The Strategic Question: "If You’re Saying Yes to This, What Are You Saying No To?"

*In which you get to the heart of overwhelm and discover the question at the
heart of every good strategy.*

George Bernard Shaw was on to something years ago when one of his maxims for
revolutionaries stated, The reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the
unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore
all progress depends on the unreasonable man."

> "Being busy is a form of laziness — lazy thinking and indiscriminate action." -- Tim Ferriss

> "The essence of strategy is choosing what not to do." -- Michael Porter

**A Yes is nothing without the No that gives it boundaries and form.**

3P model
- **Projects** What projects do you need to abandon or postpone? What meetings
  will you no longer attend? What resources do you need to divert to the Yes?
- **People** What expectations do you need to manage? From what Drama Triangle
  dynamics will you extract yourself? What relationships will you let wither?
- **Patterns** What habits do you need to break? What old stories or dated
  ambitions do you need to update? What beliefs about yourself do you need to
  let go of?

Saying Yes more slowly means being willing to stay curious before committing.

Five Strategic Questions
- What is our winning aspiration? Framing the choice as "winning" rules out
  mediocrity as an option.
- Where will we play? "Boiling the ocean" is rarely successful.
- How will we win? What’s the defendable difference that will open up the gap
  between you and the others?
- What capabilities must be in place? Not just what do you need to do, but how
  will it become and stay a strength?
- What management systems are required? It’s easy enough to measure stuff. It’s
  much harder to figure out what you want to measure that actually matters.

- TODO TheCoachingHabit.com/videos RAPID-FIRE STRATEGIC THINKING PLANNING & DOING

- TODO book Thinking, Fast and Slow,
- explains that we have two decision-making processes: a fast, instinctual
  "gut-feeling" one, and a slower, more rational one.

Cognitive biases
- first bias is the **planning fallacy**, which can be summed up as saying that
  we’re lousy at figuring out how much time something will take us to complete.
- second bias, known as **prospect theory**, tells us that loss and gain are
  not measured equally. Losing $100, say, feels worse than gaining $100 feels
  good.

## Question Masterclass Part 7 Acknowledge the Answers You Get

Remember to acknowledge the person’s answers before you leap to the next "And
what else?"

Some of my favourite replies are: FANTASTIC. I LIKE IT. GOOD ONE. NICE. YES,
THAT’S GOOD. MMM-HMMM

Here’s Your New Habit 

WHEN THIS HAPPENS… The person gives an answer to a question I’ve asked… 

INSTEAD OF… Rushing on to the next question… 

I WILL… Acknowledge the reply by saying, “Yes, that’s good.”

## 7: The Learning Question: "What Was Most Useful for You?"

*In which you discover how to finish any conversation in a way that will make
you look like a genius.*

People don’t really learn when you tell them something. They don’t even really
learn when they do something. They start learning, start creating new neural
pathways, only when they have a chance to recall and reflect on what just
happened.

## Question Masterclass Part 8 Use Every Channel to Ask a Question

Here’s Your New Habit 

WHEN THIS HAPPENS… When I get an email that triggers the Advice Monster… 

INSTEAD OF… Writing out a long, thorough answer full of possible solutions,
approaches and ideas, or even a short, terse answer with a single command… 

I WILL… Decide which one of the seven questions would be most appropriate, and
ask that question by email. It could sound like: “Wow, there’s a lot going on
here. What’s the real challenge here for you, do you think?” “I’ve scanned your
email. In a sentence or two, what do you want?” “Before I jump into a longer
reply, let me ask you: What’s the real challenge here for you?”
