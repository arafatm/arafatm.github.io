# The Manager's Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change -  Camille Fournier

## Chapter 1. Management 101

    The secret of managing is keeping the people who hate you away from the
    ones who haven’t made up their minds. Casey Stengel

What to Expect from a Manager

Benign neglect isn’t so bad when you consider some of the alternatives.

neglectful managers who ignore you when you need help

micromanagers who question every detail

actively abusive managers who neglect you until they want to yell at you

Managers who care about you as a person, and who actively work to help you grow in your career.

Managers who teach you important skills and give you valuable feedback.

Managers who help you navigate difficult situations, who help you figure out what you need to learn.

Managers who want you to take their job someday.

most importantly, managers who help you understand what is important to focus on, and enable you to have that focus.

One-on-One Meetings

meetings (1-1s) with your direct manager are an essential feature of a good working relationship.

First, they create human connection between you and your manager.

Great managers notice when your normal energy level changes, and will hopefully care enough to ask you about it.

Being an introvert is not an excuse for making no effort to treat people like real human beings,

The bedrock of strong teams is human connection, which leads to trust. And trust, real trust, requires the ability and willingness to be vulnerable in front of each other.

The second purpose of a 1-1 is a regular opportunity for you to speak privately with your manager about whatever needs discussing.

If your 1-1 is a dreadful obligation for delivering a boring status report, try using email or chat for that purpose instead

second thing to expect from your manager is feedback.

the only thing worse than getting behavioral feedback is not getting it at all, or getting it only during your performance review.

Good managers know that delivering feedback quickly is more valuable than waiting

If you’re at a company with a career ladder, sitting down with your manager and asking her what areas you need to focus on to get promoted is usually a good idea if you are actively seeking a promotion.

If you don’t ask your manager about a promotion, do not expect her to just give you one magically. If you’re unhappy with a teammate, your manager may not do anything unless you bring the issue to her attention.

Your manager should be the person who shows you the larger picture of how your work fits into the team’s goals, and helps you feel a sense of purpose in the day-to-day work.

Training and Career Growth

you are responsible, for the most part, for figuring out what types of training you want. This is especially true for individual contributors looking for training in technical areas.

When you are interested in being promoted, it’s very important to ask your manager for specific areas to focus on in order to get that promotion.

Ask the CTO: Big Ambitions

The very first thing you need to learn is how to work.

seek out a workplace where you can get mentorship and training in the aspects of doing the job (such as testing, project and product management, and collaboration)

I also advise you to find the best managers and mentors you can, and watch them work.

Try to find people to work for who push you to succeed but also reward you for success, who inspire you to stretch yourself.

you also want to spend a lot of time writing code, and getting really good at understanding how high-quality code is written.

I encourage you to create and build a strong network of peers.

How to Be Managed

Developing a sense of ownership and authority for your own experiences at work,

Spend Time Thinking About What You Want

she cannot read your mind, and she cannot tell you what will make you happy.

Use your manager to discover what’s possible where you are, but look to understand yourself in order to figure out where you want to go next.

You Are Responsible for Yourself

Bring agendas to your 1-1s

When you want to work on projects, ask. Advocate for yourself.

Seek out feedback,

Give Your Manager a Break

Her job is to do the best thing for the company and the team. It is not to do whatever it takes to make you happy all the time.

If you find yourself starting to actively resent your manager for whatever reason, you probably need to move to a different team or look for a new job.

If you find yourself resenting every manager you work for, you may need to think about whether the cause is them or you.

remember that your manager expects you to bring solutions, not problems.

When you have a problem, instead of demanding that your manager solve it for you, try asking her for advice on how she might approach the problem.

Asking for advice is always a good way to show respect and trust.

Choose Your Managers Wisely

as much as you can, consider not only the job, the company, and the pay, but also the manager when you are evaluating job opportunities.

Assessing Your Own Experience

Have you had a manager you considered good?

How often do you meet 1-1 with your manager?

Do you feel that you can tell your manager when you have a major life event?

Has your manager delivered good feedback to you?

Has your manager helped you set any work-related goals for this year?

## Chapter 2. Mentoring

The Importance of Mentoring to Junior Team Members

The mentor gets the chance to see what it is like to have responsibility for another person,

the mentee gets an overseer who is focused on him alone, without other reports clamoring for his mentor’s attention.

Being a Mentor

the worst that can happen is that a) the mentee is a drain on their time and they get less coding work done, or b) they do such a poor job that someone whom the organization might otherwise want to hire/keep around has a bad experience and doesn’t join the organization,

Mentoring an Intern

The first thing you need is some sort of project for this intern to work on.

Sit with him as much as possible these first few days.

Touch base several times a day to make sure he’s not feeling lost or overwhelmed

start applying your budding knowledge of project management to the task at hand. Is this project broken down into milestones?

Listen carefully

Listening is a precursor to empathy,

One of the early lessons in leadership, whether it is via direct management or indirect influence, is that people are not good at saying precisely what they mean in a way that others can exactly understand.

Be prepared to say anything complex a few times, in different ways.

If you feel that you don’t understand something your mentee has asked you, repeat the question in a different way.

Clearly communicate

If you expect him to do research on his own before asking you a question, tell him so!

Ask him to explain a piece of code to you, or some product or process, and point him to the documents that you believe explain it.

Calibrate your response

He can far outstrip your expectations. He can struggle with simple tasks. He can produce work very quickly, but it’s of poor quality,

learning the frequency that you need to check in with him to provide the right adjustments.

check in once a week regardless,

Ask the CTO: Mentoring a Summer Intern

Prepare for his arrival.

Have a project for him to work on.

Plan to have him present the work he did at the end of the program.

Mentoring a New Hire

Mentoring new hires is critical. Your job as a new hire mentor consists of onboarding, helping this person adjust to life in the company effectively, and building your and her network of contacts in the company.

This is an opportunity for you to see the world of your company through fresh eyes.

perspective. Effective teams have good onboarding documents they provide to new hires.

Part of the mentoring opportunity here is the chance to introduce the new person around.

Even if you have absolutely no interest in management, it’s very difficult to build a career at any company with multiple teams without building a strong network of trusted people to share information and ideas with.

Technical or Career Mentoring

When you are a mentor

Tell your mentee what you expect from him. If you want him to come prepared for your meetings with questions he has sent you in advance, ask for that.

It’s also OK to say no to mentoring.

Don’t do it unless you think it will be rewarding for you and the person you’re mentoring.

When you are a mentee

Good Manager, Bad Manager: The Alpha Geek

The alpha geek is driven to be the best engineer on the team, to always have the right answer,

values intelligence and technical skill above all other traits,

believes these attributes should determine who gets to make decisions.

usually can’t deal with dissent,

The alpha geek tries to create a culture of excellence, but ends up creating a culture of fear.

At their best, alpha geeks can be inspirational to younger developers, even though they seem very intimidating. He has all the answers.

knows exactly why that thing you’re trying to do won’t work,

At their worst, alpha geeks can’t let anyone else get any glory without claiming some of it for themselves.

They are the origin of any good ideas but had no part in creating the bad ideas, except that he knew they would fail.

Alpha geeks make absolutely terrible managers, unless they can learn to let go of their identity as the smartest person in the room

You tend to see alpha geeks in the CTO role at technology-focused startups,

Tips for the Manager of a Mentor

First of all, figure out why you are setting up this mentoring relationship in the first place.

These programs can be nice, but often the mentor and mentee are given very little guidance beyond the fact that they have been matched together.

Secondly, recognize that this is an additional responsibility for the mentor.

her productivity may slow down some during the mentoring period.

they need to be recognized for the work they put in, and the mentor should be treated as a first-class citizen with respect to other responsibilities the person might have.

unless the purpose of the mentoring program is driven from a diversity focus, give people the best mentor for their situation.

Brilliant, introverted developers may not ever want to formally manage, but encouraging them to mentor 1-1 helps them develop stronger external perspectives, not to mention their own networks.

Ask the CTO: Hiring Interns

Don’t hire interns who are not going to graduate in the year after their internship.

Your internship program is not a way for you to get extra work done in the summer; it’s a way for you to identify and attract talent.

Hiring interns is relatively easy compared to hiring full-time graduates.

push for hiring candidates from underrepresented groups.

Key Takeaways for the Mentor

Be Curious and Open-Minded

Mentoring provides a great opportunity to cultivate curiosity and see the world through fresh eyes.

Working with new people who are learning things for the first time can shed light on these hidden patterns and help you make connections you may not otherwise have made.

Listen and Speak Their Language

Senior engineers can develop bad habits, and one of the worst is the tendency to lecture and debate with anyone who does not understand them or who disagrees with what they are saying. To work successfully with a newcomer or a more junior teammate, you must be able to listen and communicate in a way that person can understand, even if you have to try several times to get it right.

Make Connections

Your career ultimately succeeds or fails on the strength of your network.

Does your company have an internship program?

How does your company think about onboarding?

Have you ever had a great mentor?

Have you ever had a mentoring relationship that didn’t work out?

## Chapter 3. Tech Lead

- more than just a good engineer.
- good communicator.
- write clear documents,
- give presentations
- talk to people in different teams
- good at prioritizing.
- willing to pick up the pieces and do what needed to be done to make progress.

Tech lead is not the job for the person who wants the freedom to focus deeply
on the details of her own code.

Added responsibilities of representing the group to management, vetting our
plans for feature delivery, and dealing with a lot of the details of the
project management process.

The tech lead role is not a point on the ladder, but a set of responsibilities
- Regular (weekly) 1-1 touchbases
- Regular feedback on career growth, progression towards goals, areas for
  improvement, and praise as warranted
- Working with reports to identify areas for learning
- Scaling themselves by delegating work effectively without micromanaging.
- focus on the whole team’s productivity and strive to increase the impact of
  the team’s work product.

    Patrick Kua in his book, Talking with Tech Leads: A leader, responsible for
    a (software) development team, who spends at least 30 percent of their time
    writing code with the team.

Tech leads are in the position to act as strong technical project leaders, and
to use their expertise at a larger scale so that their whole team gets better.

They can make independent decisions, and they play a big role in coordinating
with other nonengineering partners that their team might have.

Tech leads will be working on one major new technical skill: project
management. The work of breaking down a project

Being a tech lead is an exercise in influencing without authority.
- balancing is likely to be one of your core challenges.
- Some days you’re on a maker’s schedule, and some days you’re on a manager’s schedule.
- The worst scheduling mistake is allowing yourself to get pulled randomly into meetings.

### Being a Tech Lead 101

Your highest priority as a tech lead is taking a wide view of the work so that
you keep the project moving.
- In the systems architect and business analyst roles, you identify the
  critical systems that need to change and the critical features that need to
  be built
- Project planners break work down into rough deliverables.
- Finding places to apply agreed-upon abstractions to enable parallel work is
  key. 
  - agree upon the JSON format and start to code to that format using dummy objects.
  - start identifying priorities
- Software developers and team leaders write code, communicate challenges, and
  delegate.

You should continue writing code, but not too much.

In a healthy organization, there is no shame or harm in raising issues early.

The tech lead is called on to help architect a project, and then to go through
the steps of actually planning out the work.

The tech lead is expected to make sure the team fully understands the project
requirements, the work is planned, and the team is effective and performing
well, all without necessarily having any management responsibilities and
usually without any specific training.

It’s generally a pure increase in responsibility and scope of work. If you’re a
first-time tech lead, you have your hands very full.

### Managing Projects

Agile software development is a great way to think about work because it forces
you to focus on breaking tasks down into smaller chunks, planning those smaller
chunks out, and delivering value incrementally instead of all at once.

None of this means that you don’t need to understand how to do project
management.

You’ll have projects that for whatever reason can’t be completed in a single
sprint,

You’ll need to estimate project length for your management team,

Give some detail on why you believe things will take that long.

There are some projects, usually described by words like infrastructure,
platform, or system, that require architecture or significant advanced
planning.

When faced with this kind of project, which includes many unknowns and
relatively hard deadlines, you will find it doesn’t fit so well into the
standard agile process.

I don’t even like hiring project managers because they often act as a crutch
for engineers to use instead of learning to think through their future work and
ask real questions about what they’re doing and why

And their presence means that you have more waterfall-style projects instead of
an agile process.

Ultimately, the value of planning isn’t that you execute the plan perfectly,
that you catch every detail beforehand, or that you predict the future; it’s
that you enforce the self-discipline to think about the project in some depth
before diving in and seeing what happens.

I’ve always been surprised how grateful senior technical managers have been
when I can explain some very basic modern ideas (e.g., what’s this NoSQL stuff
all about, and why should I care?) to them in a nonthreatening and
noncondescending way.

### Managing a Project

Project management is the act of breaking a complex end goal down into smaller
pieces, putting those pieces in roughly the most effective order they should be
done, identifying which pieces can be done in parallel and which must be done
in sequence, and attempting to tease out the unknowns of the project that may
cause it to slow down or fail completely.

You are addressing uncertainty, trying to find the unknowns, and recognizing
that you are going to make mistakes in the process and miss some unknowns
despite your best efforts.

Here are some guidelines:
- Break down the work.
- Get out a spreadsheet, or a Gantt chart, or whatever works for you, and start
  breaking down your big deliverable
- Start with the biggest pieces, then break the big pieces down into smaller
  pieces, then break those down into even smaller pieces.
- If there are parts of the system you don’t understand well, ask for help from
  the person who does.
- Push through the details and the unknowns.

The trick of project management is not to stop when you feel a little bit
stuck,

A good manager will sit with you and tell you where it isn’t good enough, ask
questions to prompt you, or even work through some of it with you.

Run the project and adjust the plan as you go.

The value of a good planning process is that it helps you know approximately
how far the project has come, and approximately how far it is from completion.

Use the insights gained in the planning process to manage requirements changes.

If requirements start to change midflight, take those insights and apply them
to the changes.

If the changes add significant risk to the project, necessitate a bunch of new
planning, or simply require a lot of additional work, be clear about the cost
of those changes.

Revisit the details as you get close to completion.

Toward the end of the project, the tedium returns. It is time to really attend
to the finishing details. What is missing? What testing? What verification?

Run a premortem, an exercise where you go through all the things that could
fail on the launch of this big project.

### Decision Point: Stay on the Technical Track or Become a Manager

Good Manager, Bad Manager: The Process Czar believes that there is one true
process that, if implemented correctly and followed as designed, will solve all
of the team’s biggest problems.

Be careful of relying on process to solve problems that are a result of
communication or leadership gaps

look for self-regulating processes.

see if the process itself can be changed to be easier to follow.

automation can often make the rules more obvious.

### How to Be a Great Tech Lead

1. Understand the Architecture
2. Be a Team Player
3. Lead Technical Decisions
4. Communicate

Don’t forget to listen during all of this communication. Give others a chance
to speak, and hear what they say.
- Does your organization have tech leads? Is there is a written job description
  for this role?
- If you are considering becoming a tech lead, are you ready to push yourself?
- Have you asked your manager what he or she expects from the tech lead?
- Who is the best tech lead you ever worked with?
- Have you worked with a frustrating tech lead?

## Chapter 4. Managing People

“new manager” is an entry-level job with no seniority on any front,

Taking on a new report

Holding regular 1-1s

Giving feedback on career growth,

Working with reports to identify areas for learning and helping them grow

Starting a New Reporting Relationship Off Right

Build Trust and Rapport

How do you like to be praised, in public or in private?

What is your preferred method of communication for serious feedback?

Why did you decide to work here? What are you excited about?

How do I know when you’re in a bad mood or annoyed? Are there things that always put you in a bad mood that I should be aware of?

Are there any manager behaviors that you know you hate?

Do you have any clear career goals that I should know about so I can help you achieve them?

Any surprises since you’ve joined, good or bad, that I should know about?

Create a 30/60/90-Day Plan

Create a set of realistic milestones based on your prior hires, the current state of your technology and project, and the level of the person coming in.

Encourage Participation by Updating the New Hire Documentation

you may be the person to get this process in place, and you’ll need to reinforce it for everyone who joins the team.

Communicate Your Style and Expectations

Get Feedback from Your New Hire

Communicating with Your Team

Have Regular 1-1s

Scheduling 1-1s

default scheduling for 1-1s is weekly.

Respect the “maker schedule” for your reports

keep notes in a shared document, with you the manager playing note taker.

Good Manager, Bad Manager: Micromanager, Delegator

Micromanagement creeps up on you. A high-stress project that can’t be allowed to slip seems at risk, and so you step in to correct it.

Autonomy, the ability to have control over some part of your work, is an important element of motivation.

delegation is not the same thing as abdication.

When you’re delegating responsibility, you’re still expected to be involved as much as is necessary to help the project succeed.

Sharell didn’t just abandon Beth — she helped Beth understand the responsibilities in the new role and was there as needed to support the project.

Practical Advice for Delegating Effectively

Use the Team’s Goals to Understand Which Details You Should Dig Into

ask the team how they’re measuring their success and ask them to make that visible

if the team is making progress on its goals, the systems are stable, and the product manager is happy, I rarely dig

Gather Information from the Systems Before Going to the People

team will not be productive or happy spending half their time gathering information for you that you could easily find yourself.

Adjust Your Focus Depending on the Stage of Projects

In the beginning and design stages of a project, you may want to be more involved in order to facilitate a good set of project goals

When you’re close to a delivery date, progress details become more important,

During the normal workflow, though, it’s usually enough to know what’s moving forward and what is taking longer than expected,

Establish Standards for Code and Systems

Treat the Open Sharing of Information, Good or Bad, in a Neutral to Positive Way

Creating a Culture of Continuous Feedback

Continuous feedback is, more than anything, a commitment to regularly sharing both positive and corrective feedback.

Know your people. The first required part of successfully giving continuous feedback is a basic understanding of the individuals on your team.

Observe your people. You can’t give feedback if you aren’t paying attention.

every week there should be at least one thing you can recognize about someone on your team.

Even better, look for something to recognize weekly for everyone who reports to you.

Provide lightweight, regular feedback. Start with positive feedback.

Bonus: Provide coaching.

use coaching to ask people what they might have done differently. When things are going well, praise them, but also make suggestions as to what could be even better in the future.

Performance Reviews

Writing and Delivering a Performance Review

Give yourself enough time, and start early

Try to account for the whole year, not just the past couple of months

Use concrete examples, and excerpts from peer reviews

Spend plenty of time on accomplishments and strengths

When it comes to areas for improvement, keep it focused

Avoid big surprises

Schedule enough time to discuss the review
