#### üëã tl;dr: A user guide to working with me

Being a CEO is the dream of a lifetime for me. I care deeply about being a
great one. My goal is to **earn and retain your trust and respect**‚Äîand for you
to earn and retain mine.

This is a guide to how I operate. It‚Äôs intended to provide extreme transparency
so you can succeed in getting what you need and request from me. **It‚Äôs a
living doc,** so please ‚Äúsuggest changes‚Äù to comment or add in something for
others‚Äô benefit!

## üì∫ Communicating with me

### Channels

- For **important things <500 words:** Email
- For **important things >500 words:** Almanac Doc
- For **simple urgent things**: Text/Call (201-341-4335)
- For **complex urgent things**: Meetings
- For **casual questions or updates**: Slack
- Note: Assume I don‚Äôt see 50% of what you Slack to me. If me forgetting or not
  responding is _not_ OK, use a different channel!

### Time

- I treat my time, and therefore my calendar, as a reflection of my priorities.
  I shift things around frequently as I assess where my focus is best allocated
  day-to-day.
- I will try to be respectful of your time and keep our normal slots for 1:1s
  and such, but apologies in advance if it moves. **If it‚Äôs annoying you, tell
  me.**
- If I suggest meeting, I‚Äôll generally find a time on your calendar. **I expect
  the same of you:** if you need an urgent decision from me, schedule some
  time.

### Style

- In verbal or written form, **start direct with your update or ask.** Keep
  context to 1-2 lines max. Then, follow with supporting points or details.
- As part of my inclination towards systems thinking, I‚Äôm interested in the
  ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind your idea / conclusion / update / ask.
- _Best way to convince me:_ analyzed data
- _Also really good:_ frameworks and heuristics
- If we are struggling to align on something, **lean in.** Communicate more
  frequently, add in more detail. I‚Äôll notice, and make a similar effort.

### Following up

- We‚Äôre building an async company, so I don‚Äôt expect real-time responses on
  everything. If I do, I‚Äôll call or text you.
- **I do expect you to close the loop on important docs or emails within 24
  hours of receipt:**
- If I send an email to inform you, I like a ‚Äúreceived‚Äù or ‚Äúlooking at it‚Äù
- If I ask for something in an email, doc, or comment, ideally with an ‚Äúon it‚Äù
  and a time expectation on turnaround
- I will do the same any time you send or ask something of me!
- As part of managing me, I expect you to proactively communicate with me,
  especially around the priorities we‚Äôve agreed for you or your team‚Äôs work.
  That includes regular status updates, blockers, and wins.
- **I get frustrated when I have to repeatedly ask for an update** on things
  I‚Äôve asked of you and you‚Äôve agreed to.

## ‚õµ Reporting to me

### 1:1s

- I like to meet at least once a week with you.
- We should have an **Almanac doc with notes from all of our 1:1s.** Each
  meeting should end with a list of tasks.
- I like when you **bring a written agenda** in our doc to our 1:1s. It should
  include:
- Metric-based status updates on your priorities
- Strategic things you‚Äôd like to think through with me
- Blockers I can lift to speed you up, empower you, or make your life easier
- How you‚Äôre doing and feeling
- If you don‚Äôt have an agenda, here‚Äôs the questions I will default to asking
  you: [Internal CEO/Employee 1:1s at
  Almanac](https://almanac.io/docs/script-internal-ceo-employee-1-1s-at-almanac-81bf492c6f04f4b3447abf6451f9ec28)
- I always end with **‚ÄúDo you have any feedback for me?‚Äù**
- If all is fine, that‚Äôs great!
- But please be candid and specific if you do have feedback.

### Strategy

- I have a strategy background, and so at the very least I‚Äôd like to be
  involved in co-creating your team's strategy with you. I will never be hands
  off around strategy.
- Aligning on strategy for your department is an ongoing process, though every
  6 months as an exec team we will pull up to reevaluate the company‚Äôs
  direction.
- At least until we find product/market fit, I think about our company in a
  [wartime stance](https://a16z.com/2011/04/14/peacetime-ceowartime-ceo-2/).
  We‚Äôre trying to do an ambitious thing in a fast-moving market with limited
  resources and tough competition. **I see my #1 job as getting us all swimming
  in the same direction.**
- Therefore, I expect the strategy for your team to align with our company
  vision and six-month strategy.
- If you want to deviate from our company strategy, that implies you have
  concerns about the overall direction. Come prepared to chat with data or
  frameworks, because I will naturally push back. I‚Äôve been convinced to shift
  direction by the team many times since we started Almanac, so you might be
  right!
- I believe strategy means focus, and focus means tradeoffs. Your highest value
  add strategically is to help us make tradeoffs. Start with outlining the
  options or the stakes‚Äîyou don‚Äôt always need to make the decision yourself.

### Priorities & Tracking

- If you're a team leader, I expect you to **report weekly, via metrics, on
  your monthly priorities.**
- This should happen in our 1:1s, and likely at our All Hands in front of the
  whole team.
- We set monthly priorities as an exec team (we call them OKRs). You‚Äôll be
  assigned some as the **Directly Responsible Individual**. Some functions,
  like engineering or customer service, have more implicit priorities around
  fulfillment that supports our broader goals.
- I expect you to have **at most 1-2 documents/databases/spreadsheets that are
  single sources of truth for your department.**
- Pet peeves around data:
- Complex SaaS tools that aren‚Äôt easily adjustable. Just use Mode, Airtable,
  Sheets/Slides, or an Almanac Doc!
- Information that isn‚Äôt analyzed, and data in different places.
- Don‚Äôt wait for me to ask how it‚Äôs going! Proactively communicate status,
  wins, and blockers. I will get irritated if I have to follow up on a specific
  ask I made.

### Resources

- We must return the funds we raised for Almanac 10x+ to our investors. **Our
  money is not free, it did not magically appear, and it is not endless.**
- If you need resources (budget, new people, overhead expenses):
- Whenever possible, model out the return on investment (using numbers).
- Show 2-3 alternatives to your recommendation; it‚Äôs great when you do some
  research.
- Include benchmarks from other high-performing companies.
- Treat it like an experiment: ‚Äúif X happens we should scale; if Y happens it
  failed and we can shut it down."
- Show me you're being cost-conscious and value-oriented.
- I love doing this kind of work with you; **we can always partner on the WIP
  analysis** (and as long as I own the company budget, you‚Äôll eventually need
  to pass the forecast to me).

### Onboarding

- First: if we‚Äôre working together, **I think you‚Äôre amazing,** and better at
  your job than I could be if I were doing it. Starting a new job can be
  nerve-wracking, but know I‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôre on our team. üòÉ
- In your first 4 weeks, your main task is to listen and observe how we do
  things. There will be time later to give me feedback and start improving
  things‚Äîthat‚Äôs why you‚Äôre here after all‚Äîbut it‚Äôs best to **understand first
  and build trusting, respectful relationships.** You risk that if you try to
  change things too soon that your peers have built and whose faults they often
  know best!
- I will often start you off with some initial projects to help you get your
  feet wet. This is intentional, and not about a lack of trust. If things are
  going well, you‚Äôll move quickly to the deep end.
- I believe trust is at the core of healthy relationships, and you‚Äôll know you
  have mine if I start to communicate less frequently. I still expect you to
  communicate proactively to me (see above).
- In your first 4 weeks, we‚Äôll find an hour to talk about your professional
  development goals. [The template is
  here](https://almanac.io/docs/month-1-professional-development-chat-wtwCFtEaUlYV1YOOLia9ZTqysvM6kAGP).
- After 4 weeks, we do a culture diagnostic; your fresh eyes help us understand
  how our culture looks to an outsider. It‚Äôs not a test, but rather feedback
  for us. [The template is
  here](https://almanac.io/docs/month-1-ceo-catchup-template-urUIc4rfevhLOieaCG50FI6Q7gy0g0NI).

## ‚õ∞Ô∏è Professional Development

- More than anything Almanac can pay you, I believe **what you learn and how
  you grow during your time here is our best form of compensation**. It lasts
  for life, it compounds with experience, and it passes on to everyone you
  touch.
- I try very hard to hire people who I‚Äôd like to work for myself, and who are
  meaningfully better than me at the technical aspects of their jobs. It‚Äôs
  unlikely I can be a hard skills mentor to you in your role. Please treat my
  ignorance kindly.
- Coaching & mentoring is one of my strengths, and I get a lot of energy from
  helping you grow as a general manager and leader. **Please engage me on any
  management challenges you‚Äôre facing; I love workshopping them with you!**
- How I commit to helping you succeed:
- Being a true advocate for your growth and success at Almanac and beyond
- Providing you with a vision and mission that inspires you to do your best
- Surrounding you with a team and culture that push you to do even better
- Getting you the resources you need to succeed and removing blockers in your
  way
- Creating an accountability system that empowers you to make a huge impact
  with minimal overhead and friction
- Tactical things I can do to help you grow even faster:
- Give you ever more ambitious goals or more challenging opportunities, should
  you request them and are ready for them
- Connect you to benchmark organizations and leaders with whom you can commune
  as peers
- Consistently providing you with positive and constructive feedback (see
  below)

## ‚õ∑Ô∏è Feedback

Feedback is hard! I strongly encourage you to read [Radical
Candor](https://www.amazon.com/Radical-Candor-Kim-Scott/dp/B01KTIEFEE); Almanac
will reimburse you for it. It‚Äôs the best book on the topic of interpersonal
relationships at work.

### From you to me

- **I gain my energy, and my authority, from your trust and respect.** I make
  many decisions in our relationship around earning and keeping yours. And it‚Äôs
  a huge source of anxiety for me when I sense I don‚Äôt have it‚ÄîI literally lose
  sleep.
- Candor is an Almanac
  [virtue](https://www.amazon.com/Radical-Candor-Kim-Scott/dp/B01KTIEFEE), so
  **you should commit to providing me radically candid feedback** when I‚Äôm
  blocking our success. That means:
- Showing that you trust, respect, and care for me personally
- Challenging me directly, armed with data or frameworks
- **I love constructive feedback...**
- When I‚Äôve assigned or asked for too much work
- When I‚Äôm diluting focus for the team or creating directional confusion
- When our metrics are too ambitious or deadlines are unrealistic
- When the priorities or sequencing don‚Äôt make sense
- When I‚Äôve said the wrong thing, or a thing in the wrong way
- When you feel I‚Äôve done something in conflict with our
  [virtues](https://www.amazon.com/Radical-Candor-Kim-Scott/dp/B01KTIEFEE)
- I am human, I am flawed. Sometimes, CEOs are perceived as superhuman; **I
  promise I am not as good or as bad as it may seem.** Please think about how
  you give feedback.
- I don‚Äôt believe in shit sandwiches; no need to sugarcoat it. Instead, try
  empathy and showing that you made an effort to understand why I did what I
  did.
- The best tactic for good feedback conversations: **repeating back what I just
  said to you before sharing your next thought.** Works every time.
- Feedback can be positive! **If I do something well, please tell me‚Äîand be
  specific.** Positive affirmation is one of my love languages, and it gives me
  so much energy when I succeed at something I work hard at. üåü
- Positive relationships typically have a 5 positive : 1 negative feedback
  ratio. Let‚Äôs try for that.
- **I care about your feedback**, and am very serious about responding to it. I
  hope I‚Äôm so good at this you list it as a strength in my 360 review. I don‚Äôt
  like yes people; I want you to make Almanac iconic and push me to up my game.
  If you give great feedback in the right way, you‚Äôll be rewarded and our
  relationship will grow stronger.
- **Be clear with me on how I can best work for you.** This specifically means
  changes to your role, responsibilities, opportunities, compensation, feedback
  levels, business context, interactions with team, board, or customers.
- I ask about your needs and preferences in our initial professional
  development conversation, but be proactive if there‚Äôs anything I can do to
  support you better.
- When you succeed, Almanac does too. If it‚Äôs helpful, consider writing a user
  guide like this for yourself.

### From me to you

- **You gain my trust and respect from 1) delivering on your priorities 2) in
  alignment with our vision and**
  [**virtues**](https://almanac.io/docs/almanac-s-virtues-334e98312500c717a6e189e6ba184b68)**.**
  Both are essential. If you deliver results but are a jerk to me or others, or
  want to build a different business, you likely aren‚Äôt a fit for Almanac.
- I love it when you succeed, in both small tactical settings (you made a great
  comment, you managed a situation well) and big strategic ways (you nailed
  your OKRs). I often recognize it (publicly or privately). **Specifically, I
  love seeing behaviors aligned with my values and Almanac‚Äôs virtues:**
- Speed
- Passion
- Intelligence
- Creativity
- Bandwidth
- Resilience
- I will also give you constructive feedback. Themes might include:
- You are doing work that‚Äôs **not aligned with our vision**. We need to be
  swimming in the same direction.
- You‚Äôre **giving up too soon** or not demonstrating tenacity. Startups win
  often just by not giving up. To change my mind, bring data or a framework.
- You‚Äôre producing **low quality work**. Laziness is unacceptable. I will
  assume you don‚Äôt care enough to put in the time. The alternative is even
  worse.
- You aren‚Äôt showing enough **intellectual rigor**. I love it when you make
  decisions using the best available internal data and external wisdom and
  combine them into first-rate analysis. If your decision is off by 2 degrees,
  we‚Äôll lose by a mile.
- You aren‚Äôt displaying curiosity or **a learning mindset**, which often looks
  like being too sure of your own conclusions without expressing risks or
  doubt.
- You‚Äôre not **acting like an owner**. If it‚Äôs broke and you can fix it, fix
  it. Please don‚Äôt complain to me without proposing a solution.
- If when leading a team, you‚Äôre **not showing positive energy** and enthusiasm
  for our mission. Startups are inherently scary, and it‚Äôs your job to
  manufacture momentum for those around you.
- You‚Äôre not **proactively communicating** with me. If you miss a goal and I
  hadn‚Äôt heard about it before the finish line, it‚Äôs on you.
- I typically try to give feedback, within one week, in the following format:
- First, I share the facts of what happened from my perspective.
- Then, I express the effect it had on me and why it matters.
- Finally, I end with a request.
- I will ask for your thoughts or feelings, repeat them back so you know I
  heard you, and then clarify the feedback or request.
- In giving you feedback, I will inevitably rub you the wrong way or hurt your
  feelings. **Know my intent is to help you be better, because I care about
  you.**
- We have an autonomy-driven culture where trust is the lifeblood of our work
  together. If I lose trust in you, you‚Äôll know it because it will feel like
  I‚Äôm micromanaging. This can be solved by being proactively communicating how
  you‚Äôre fixing the thing.

## üèì For Almanac Execs

### Contributing to the Exec team

- The executive team is actually your FIRST team. Our ability to converge on an
  aligned plan is the **highest-leverage activity we can do to produce
  company-wide results.**
- Cohesion amongst us vibrates throughout the company, as does tension. It‚Äôs
  not just my responsibility to create positive outcomes on the Exec team;
  **it‚Äôs yours too.**
- Our Exec meetings are a critical time. I expect you to:
- Pay attention and **not multitask**
- Listen deeply, **be empathetic**, work to grasp the nuances, and reflect back
- Be engaged and **participate verbally**; if you‚Äôre quiet, I assume:
- You‚Äôre frustrated and don‚Äôt agree, and will provide feedback to me later
- You agree and don‚Äôt want to waste time -> ping me
- As an Exec team member, I expect you to:
- Feel responsibility for **our company strategy**
- **Help find the quickest path** to our goals
- **Document everything** your team does in the handbook

### Managing your team

- I want to continually uplevel our team and ensure we have stunning
  colleagues; I will:
- **Help you recruit** for your open slots, including selling the shit out of
  our vision
- Push you to **transition out low performers**‚Äîand will get frustrated when we
  take too long to act
- Encourage you to **reward our rockstars and superstars** with public/private
  feedback, increasing responsibility, and higher compensation
- Help you **craft employee departures** and communications to the rest of the
  team, including me taking responsibility for the decision
- Get you **get an executive coach** \- I believe we should all have them, and
  we are considering having Almanac cover their costs in 2021
- In return, I expect you to:
- Collaborate with me closely on the **design of your team‚Äôs structure**
- Involve me deeply in **any recruiting process for** your open roles
- **Never surprise me** with personnel or culture issues
- **Create and update your team‚Äôs handbook:**
- Your team‚Äôs mission, vision, and values
- Your team‚Äôs strategy and priorities and current metrics
- Your team‚Äôs processes
- Your team‚Äôs cultural norms

## üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è My management style

### üôè My values

My values drive everything I do: how I use my time, how I make decisions, and
how I interact with others:
- Impact
- Excellence
- Ambition
- Creativity
- Play
- Adventure
- Community

### üí™ My strengths

- I practice trying to see around the bend and imagining how things could be.
  I‚Äôm inherently optimistic about ideas, companies, and people. Pursuing bold,
  even crazy, goals gives me a ton of energy. People have told me I can create
  ‚Äúreality distortion fields" that motivate and inspire them.
- I care deeply about the things I‚Äôm involved in and the people I surround
  myself with. I spend many of my free moments thinking about their (your!)
  success.
- I‚Äôm a systems thinker; I enjoy examining the many facets of a problem,
  product, or person to understand the why, the how, and the so what.
- Ownership is my MO; I often dive into head-first, especially if I‚Äôm asking
  others to.
- I can move easily between operating creatively and strategically at a high
  level, and tactically and practically in the weeds.
- I can communicate fairly well, which I think is about taking complex and
  confusing concepts and making them simple and compelling.
- I have extremely high-bandwidth; I can do a lot of high-quality work very
  quickly and in parallel. I have a lot of persistence.
- I have high standards and hold others to them, which has frequently resulted
  in people growing and doing more than they thought they could around me.
- I appreciate nuance, and can hold two conflicting ideas in my head at once.
- I‚Äôm outgoing and social. I‚Äôd spend every waking moment with other people if I
  could, and really enjoy getting into collaborative flow with teams.
- I can ‚Äúturn it off‚Äù and know how to enjoy myself, which I do through a fairly
  full life of social dinners, travel, skiing, surfing, biking, reading, and
  movies.

### üòß My weaknesses

First, some helpful context. I used to competitively ski race. The sport
involves hitting as many poles as possible as quickly as possible‚Äîwhile flying
down an icy slope on thin metal edges. All that practice has become part of my
approach to work and life, which can lead to:
- Taking on more than I can handle‚Äîand asking others to do the same. If I ask
  for too much, propose a choice and outline the tradeoffs for me. 
- Being unreasonably optimistic around what‚Äôs possible, and leaning hard into
  promising ideas. I also might come across as more sure than I actually am. If
  you're unsure, ask!
- Having unreasonable expectations around timing. I want to win as soon as
  possible.
- Trying to will performance or results into existence through sheer effort. If
  something‚Äôs not working, I often get more involved, or try to do it myself.
- Accumulating, versus mitigating, risk. When something's not working, my
  tendency can be to add or try something new v. fixing the thing that's
  broken.
- Getting frustrated when there‚Äôs tension or lack of alignment.

Some of these qualities can make a good entrepreneur, but they also have a dark
side if not applied correctly. If you feel I cross the line on any of these,
please give me feedback (see above) or jokingly call me out by saying, "Adam,
this isn't skiing!"

**An important interpersonal weakness to be aware of:**
- When I perceive a gap between the things I‚Äôm responsible for and the things I
  control, my emotions can take over and I can become a bad collaborator. If I
  seem this way, the best thing you can do is help me feel a sense of control
  again.
- If you lose my trust or respect, I may come across as withholding or
  condescending. Difficult as it is, please call me out on it so we can talk it
  through. It‚Äôs likely fixable.

**‚ÄúI am human‚Äù disclaimers:**
- I am flawed. I am frequently wrong. I can be inconsiderate. I sometimes say
  the wrong thing. Please forgive me.
- I‚Äôm working on it. I spend many hours a week with a community of people‚Äîmy
  therapist, executive coach, personal trainer, mentors, friends‚Äîtrying to
  become a better me.
- I‚Äôm grateful for your help. The best thing you can do is offer me radically
  candid feedback.

#### Sustainability rainbow

With my executive coach, I often use a color code to communicate how I‚Äôm doing.
This helps to contextualize everything I say afterwards with my emotional
state. I‚Äôm sharing this for transparency; feel free to ask me how I‚Äôm doing, or
share where you are during a 1:1!
- **Blue:** Truly living in the moment, present, balanced, weightless.
- **Green:** Energized, happy, flow state. Helping other people be their best.
- **Yellow:** Some stress, but manageable, nothing totally broken, most
  important things done, didn‚Äôt cause anyone serious delay.
- **Orange:** Incapable of doing deep work, basic functioning, might be able to
  get 1 personal thing done. Might be causing someone a delay.
- **Red:** Cognitive delays, borderline burnout, definitely not serving the
  team well.
- **Dark Red:** Depressed, need time off.

## üç∏ Logistics

- I assess whether a day was good or bad based on if I can workout. **Please
  encourage me to close my computer and get outside**, mainly by respecting my
  exercise blocks.
- I‚Äôm bad at Slack (and text). Sorry.
- **I think everyone has a ‚Äúbaby‚Äù:** a real human to take care of, or a
  passion, or a priority. Tell me what it is and I will respect it.
- I love flow-state conversations: about Almanac, startups, skiing/surfing,
  politics, airlines, design, movies/TV, or anything else. My favorite 1:1s are
  when we get into this place.
- For anything urgent, I‚Äôm available 24/7. I'm here for you!
