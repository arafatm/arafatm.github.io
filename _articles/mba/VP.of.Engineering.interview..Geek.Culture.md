One of my interviewing habits is to write down questions I was asked alongside
my responses to them. I do this as a way to self debrief and reflect on how
well I think I did. Over the years, I have collected quite a few questions from
interviewing for VP of Engineering positions. This post will offer some insight
into some of the more salient questions. However, before diving into the
questions, it might be worth describing the structure of a VP of Engineering
interview. The following is entirely based on my personal experience and is not
necessarily indicative of a trend or pattern.

In my experience, the structure of a VPE interview is ~60 minute sessions with
each of the following: CEO, CTO, CPO, Head of People and either the Head of
Sales or Marketing. I have also been interviewed numerous times by members of
the Board. Additionally, most of my interviews included me presenting to a
panel which is typically the entire leadership team. The panel interview is
often-times me presenting about one or more topics shared ahead of time.

The below outlines some of the common or interesting questions that I have
encountered. I group them by the persona asking them. While I do not make an
attempt to answer the questions, I will try and dive a bit deeper into one
question per section.

## CTO & CPO

These two interviews are arguably the most important to do well on. As an
incoming VPE you are expected to work extremely close to the CTO and the CPO.
Additionally, it has been my experience that the CTO is almost always a
co-founder and would have been up to the point of hiring a VPE managing the
engineering team. As such, they have a very strong interest in ensuring that
the right person takes over the reins from them.

1. **If someone on your team were to guess what it is you do on any given day,
   what would they say?**
2. How do you structure engineering teams? How does PM fit into this structure?
3. What is the reasonable interaction between PM and Engineering? What do you
   need from a PM organization?
4. What are some of the friction points between Product & Engineering and how
   do you handle them?
5. What is your biggest accomplishment leading an engineering team?

The “guess what Karim is doing” is a very interesting question. It’s one I was
asked once, and to be frank it stomped me (I did get the job). It’s not that I
do not know what it is I do, it is that I do not know what the interviewer, in
this case the CTO is trying to assess from my response. It turns out that they
were trying to find out the overlap between what I do versus what the team
needs. For example, had I mentioned things like design reviews, code reviews
and coding whilst the team needs more of a manager persona, then that would be
indicative of a poor fit.

I won’t summarize my answer here, but it’s not that much different than what I
outline in my article on “ [What does VP of Engineering
do](https://medium.com/geekculture/what-does-a-vp-engineering-do-4855bd3806e3)
“

## CEO

CEO interviews tended to be either at the very beginning of the process or the
very end. If they are at the very end, they’ll usually spend more time talking
about the business and trying to close you. CEOs are almost always interested
in hearing your story, what led you to them today.

1. **How do you increase your team’s throughput?**
2. Why did they ultimately leave their company for the next role?
3. If I called your previous CEO, how would they describe you
4. Tell me your story?

I’ve been asked the “throughput” question twice, both times using the exact
word. I’ll be honest, I dislike the question. Not because I cannot answer it,
but because it offers a narrow view of an engineering team; a conveyor belt of
features that should move as fast as possible. While I do understand the intent
behind the question, the word throughput triggers me. That could also be a
result of ~7yrs working in the file-systems space.

My one advice when answering this question is to ask clarifying questions
before responding. A CEO asking this question is concerned about the velocity
of features coming out of the engineering team; they are observing a symptom
not a root cause. Ask them why they think the team isn’t performing well. The
response they give might offer you a root cause or at least provide you with a
more structured and specific answer versus a very open ended one. For example,
when I dug deeper once I found out that the “throughput” was slow because the
team would deliver the wrong features, a function of poor scoping and problem
definition. So, before you offer your Kanban boards or your agile processes and
your exceptional hiring skills, just dig a bit deeper to get to the root cause.

## Head of People

The Head of People interview is, unsurprisingly, going to focus on your people
management skills. One very common topic is that of hiring, especially for an
incoming VPE at a series-A or B startup. You are expected to scale the team,
which is a function of hiring and building people programs in support of this
hiring.

1. **How do you scale an engineering team?**
2. Have you fired employees, why and how
3. What people programs did you put in place as the team grew? How?
4. What’s your weakness? What’s your biggest failure

There’s no right way to answer the scaling the team question, but there’s a
wrong one. The Head of People is looking to assess if you are a good partner
for her team, meaning will you be a true partner with the recruiting team or
simply offload all the work to them. A good answer should cover topics like
structuring a repeatable and objective interview process, identifying sources
of candidates (industry, referrals, college) and guiding the recruiting team on
how to source for good candidates. All of these activities are ones the VPE
needs to lead. Remember scaling a team is >> interviewing.

## Head of Sales/Marketing

I’ve had interviews with heads of sales or marketing 50% of the time. They are
rare, but I found them very insightful. Most of the insights were me asking
questions, which I will share in a later post.

1. **How does engineering support sales?**
2. Walk me through a challenging customer interaction. What happened and what
   did you do

It should come as no surprise that the Head of Sales will be mighty vested in
how you can help her team sell more. The main avenue for engineering helping
sales win deals is handling one-off feature requests. I wrote about this topic
in the “ [Feature
deal-making](https://medium.com/codex/feature-deal-blockers-cdceef74f92d) “
article. In the early stages of a startup, it is not unexpected to encounter a
customer willing to buy your product only if a certain feature(s) are
implemented. In comes the VPE to help make this happen.

## Panel interview

The intent of the panel interview is to assess your written and verbal
communication skills. I’ve had panel interviews in almost all my VPE positions
I pursued, so it’s a pretty common format. As a VPE you are expected to possess
reasonable written and communication skills. You might be asked to present at a
conference, your team, to customers, to share written context with your team
and so on. All of these require a good command of written and verbal
communication.

The questions are always shared ahead of the time and the delivery is either a
written document of a presentation. Regardless of the format, you will always
be required to present your thoughts to the panel, which as I mentioned will be
the company’s leadership team. Regardless of the format, the topic that you
will be asked to write on could be somewhat vague (see the question I
highlighted below). You will have to make reasonable assumptions and proceed
from those. Not only is the intent of the panel interview to assess your
written and communication skills, but it’s an opportunity for the company to
assess your thinking. Can you make reasonable assumptions and structure
arguments of hypotheses based on those?

1. Please write a document of significance showing your ability to manage and
   communicate upwards, e.g. something that communicates a new or key
   initiative to the CTO; (e.g., communication, ppt, xls, or word doc).
2. What is the most inventive or innovative thing you’ve done? It doesn’t have
   to be something that’s patented. It could be a process change, product idea,
   a new metric or customer facing interface — something that was your idea. It
   cannot be anything your current or previous employer would deem confidential
   information. Please provide us with context to understand the
   invention/innovation. What problem were you seeking to solve? Why was it
   important? What was the result? Why or how did it make a difference and
   change things?
3. Describe what the components are and how you would go about developing a
   30–60–90 day plan at The Company.
4. Given what you know about current Company’s technology and scale, present a
   technology organization plan for a team that is double in size, from x to
   2x.
5. **Your team is unable to deliver features on time and is suffering from poor
   morale. What could be going on?**

I highlighted the “team unable to deliver” question because the format was
quite unusual. The question was shared with me at the beginning of the panel
interview and I was given 30 minutes to construct my response. I came up with a
few hypotheses and presented them to the panel. During my presentation, the
panel would share relevant information, in response to some of my hypotheses.
The whole process was similar to [“Chose Your Own
Adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure) “ books. I
recall alluding to poor scoping of projects, and was given additional
information. It turns out that the CTO has a habit of parachuting in at the
last minute and changing project requirements. This can definitely demotivate a
team and introduce risk on their ability to deliver features. By the way, the
CTO was part of the panel and fully acknowledged that he does that and needs to
change that behavior.

## Board Members

I’ve been interviewed by members of the Board 50% of the time, once with the
entire board members (one at a time), which was fun. Interviews with members of
the BoD occur at the very end of the process. The good news is, if you made it
to the BoD then the company is leaning towards hiring you. The BoD are
typically the investors in the company and have one main interest: can you help
make the company successful, and hence provide a meaningful return on their
investment. The VPE plays an incredibly critical role at a startup, hence they
have a very strong vested interest to ensure that you are the right person.

1. What’s interesting to you about this company? What do you think you can add
   to the team?
2. What are the challenges in scaling a company from 0–20M in revenue/ARR?
3. What are some of the challenges you’ve seen when acquiring enterprise
   customers?
4. **We’ve had quality issues, what do you do?**
5. What can you do to accelerate product delivery?

I highlighted the “quality” question because it was a bit unusual to be asked
this from a member of the Board. Keep in mind that a Board typically meets
every 12 weeks and will get a summarized view of the more critical aspects of
the day to day operations of the company. Therefore, a board member asking you
about quality implies that the issue is critical enough to be shared by the
company with their Board. While not exactly a red flag, it is one that should
give you slight concern. More worrying you will not get a whole lot of details
from the board member, they won’t know why quality is poor. They know that it
is, and hope that you can fix this problem!

I have a much longer set of questions, some I encountered and others not. I
compiled those all in this public document
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aOYKsYU6XqIqfjO4uIzYTqkxPcYnljwd5zHMG5ax7JQ/edit).
In the next article, I will cover what a VPE should ask and try and discover
during the interview process. Remember, an interview is a bi-directional
assessment!
