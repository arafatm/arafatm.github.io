# How to learn about someone's core needs

The [6 core needs that humans have at work (BICEPS)](https://www.palomamedina.com/biceps) 
are on my mind _all of the time_. 

In the past, I’ve talked about how to use the BICEPS core needs list to:
* [Create predictability and stability in times of rapid change](https://larahogan.me/blog/predictability-stability-terrible-times/)
* [Improve cross-functional relationships](https://larahogan.me/blog/cross-functional-relationships/)
* [Communciate big news to your team](https://larahogan.me/blog/communicating-news-to-team/)
* [Offer challenges to your teammates](https://larahogan.me/blog/benefits-offering-challenges/)
* [Manage up effectively](https://larahogan.me/blog/how-to-manage-up/)

And so on. You can also leverage your knowledge of these core needs to give
successful feedback, influence others and enact positive change, pinpoint team
friction, sensitively deliver bad news, the list goes on.

But first, you need to know _which_ of the core needs is **most important** for
the person you’re talking to. Humans are really bad at guessing which of the
core needs is feeling threatened or undernourished for others, and the same
stimulus can threaten **any** of these six core needs at any time! (Look at how
[desk moves](https://larahogan.me/blog/desk-moves/) can mess with all six!)

So how do you figure out which of these core needs matters _the most_ to the
person you’re talking to?

## Ask these questions:

You can mix and match! Choose your own adventure:
1. What feels most **important** to you about _\[meeting/project/process/situation\]_?
2. What challenges are you most **concerned** with (or focused on) right now?
   Or—in an ideal world—how would we move this forward?
3. What one thing do you **wish you could change** about this?
4. I have an idea I need your advice on _\[share idea\]_—
  - What do you think I need to do to get others **on board**?  
  - (Or) What key **concerns or goals** do you think I should keep my eye on during this?
5. If you were me, **how would you handle** _\[meeting/project/process/situation\]_ ?  
  - Tell me more about what made you choose that route?
6. If _\[this thing\]_ happens, how would that **impact** you/your crew?
7. What are you **optimizing** for?
    
You can follow up with more great, succinct open questions (with examples of
what NOT to ask!) [here](http://bit.ly/20openquestions).

## When asking these questions:

1. **Ask them to expand on something so you can understand the underlying
   values and passions.** If they say “I am really worried about this
   deadline!” ask them to expand: “Oh, say more about that…” or “Ah, which part
   do you think is the most likely to lead to that?”

2. **ALWAYS confirm with them if your inference is correct.** “So, if you and I
   checked in more frequently over Slack, you would feel better about this, did
   I get that right?”

3. **Check your tone and nonverbal communication.** There are a million ways to
   say any one sentence; the right tone conveys you’re listening and open to
   their thoughts, and you’re confident you can figure out a win-win. The wrong
   tone conveys you don’t actually care about their perspective, you’re going
   to unload your feedback and you don’t care about how they feel. One will be
   heard and acted upon, the other kills trust.
