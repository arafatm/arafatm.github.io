title: So you want to be a COO
---




A fun aspect of business school is exploring what you want to become. My dad, a
successful small business owner, always encourages me to “think big.” It’s a
broad statement but it has been a mantra for me in my exploration. Many
business students feel prepared to become a manager–Product Manager, Operations
Manager, Marketing Manager, etc. Is this “big” enough? Are we preparing
ourselves to become executives? This semester, I undertook an independent study
to understand the role of the Chief Operating Officer. I wanted to understand
how COOs charted their careers, what their responsibilities include, how they
interact with the rest of the C-Suite, and what mental models they use to be
successful. I conducted research by interviewing COOs and by reading books and
articles.

## Why COO?

Ever since I discovered a natural talent for [SET](https://www.setgame.com/set)
as a five-year-old, I’ve identified as excellent at pattern recognition. I love
to scan broadly, diagnose what’s going on, design ways forward, and execute. As
a programmer at the Federal Reserve Board, I managed hundreds of computer
programs, some originally written in 1987. Optimizing that bird’s nest was
fun–I had to have a broad picture of how and why all the programs fit together
as well as the ability to drill down into any single line of code to fix it. At
the time, it was the perfect mix of systems thinking and detail-oriented
execution.

As I grew professionally, I wanted to take on bigger, more complex problems
than programming presented. I joined the Business Operations team at Opower, a
SaaS company helping 50+ million homes and businesses save energy. I served the
Product, Engineering, and Client Success divisions. I analyzed operational
data, listened to staff, observed teams, and partnered with senior directors to
improve efficiency, quality, margins, and the employee experience. This career
evolution involved working deeply with people. I loved it.

Interning at [IDEO](https://www.ideo.com/), I learned how to apply Design
Thinking to drive internal transformations. I loved that work more than
anything I’d done before. It was creative, collaborative, and deeply effective.

So, what executive oversees internal operations, coaches people to do their
best work, drives innovation, all while supporting the company’s
forward-looking strategy? **The COO.**

I interviewed six COOs. Four work at startups with 40 or fewer employees; one
works at a company with 200 people; and one works at a 500-person company. All
were within technology companies, spanning the e-commerce, financial services,
gaming, and healthcare industries. Unsurprisingly, the COOs working at startups
are younger than those serving in larger companies.

## The Scope of the COO Role

The COO makes their organization work better. Most typically, the COO is the
“heads down” counterpart to the “heads up” CEO. While the CEO leads external
affairs and drives the vision, the COO makes the vision a reality. According to
_How to be a Chief Operating_ _Officer_ by Jennifer Geary, the COO role rests
on three fundamental pillars and oversees some or all of 13 technical areas.
The pillars should apply to every COO whereas the technical areas a COO leads
depends on company and C-Suite context.

**Pillars**
1. **Culture.** Culture impacts every aspect of the company, so it is naturally
   within the COO’s purview to optimize it. While this is easier said than
   done, it’s incumbent upon you to figure out how to do it: learn from experts
   (like MIT Sloan Professor Emeritus [Edgar
   Schein](https://www.humansynergistics.com/blog/culture-university/details/culture-university/2014/03/03/culture-fundamentals---9-important-insights-from-edgar-schein)),
   seek help from culture consultants, read books about it. Just get to work:
   you can and will affect culture, whether you know it or not. Your words and
   actions will be seen and internalized. As Geary says, **“culture change
   always starts today.”**
2. **Strategy.** Geary suggests, “if the organization you joined already has a
   strong strategy, you can get straight to execution. If the strategy is weak,
   your priority is to re-define it.” You’ll need to understand your company’s
   purpose, its changing environment, and how to proactively or reactively lead
   the company through obstacles to achieve its purpose.
3. **Change.** If you want to adjust the culture or strategy in any way, you
   need to know how to lead change. Geary goes so far to say that “your role as
   COO is overseeing change.” As an Organizational Designer at IDEO, I learned
   to use the atomic elements of organizations as the levers you can adjust to
   drive change. Two popular organizational frameworks are [the McKinsey 7S
   Operating
   Model](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/enduring-ideas-the-7-s-framework)
   and [John Galbraith’s Star
   Model](http://www.jaygalbraith.com/images/pdfs/StarModel.pdf). Two popular
   frameworks for leading change are [Lean Six
   Sigma](https://www.isixsigma.com/implementation/change-management-implementation/lean-six-sigma-can-serve-change-management-tool/)
   and [John Kotter’s 8-step
   process](https://www.kotterinc.com/8-steps-process-for-leading-change/).

**13 Technical Areas**
1. IT
2. Finance
3. HR
4. Operations
5. Risk
6. Governance
7. Legal
8. Compliance
9. Supply Chain
10. Facilities
11. Internal Communications & Public Relations
12. Sustainability
13. Safeguarding of Vulnerable People

EY synthesized the COO role nicely in their report, [_Aiming for the top: a
guide for aspiring COOs and their
organizations_](https://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/Aiming_for_the_top/$FILE/EY-Aiming-for-the-top.pdf)
(2013). The graphic below summarizes the scope of the COO role.

## No two COO positions are the same

As one COO I interviewed put it, “the COO is whatever the CEO doesn’t want to
be or do.” Typically, CEOs are external facing. They lead the vision, serve as
chairperson of the Board, serve as the face of the company for media reports
and marketing campaigns, manage investor relationships, etc. In this typical
case, almost all internal operations are left to the COO. However, what the CEO
actually takes on depends on the stage of the company, what they are good at,
and what they enjoy working on. Since this is based on the CEO’s personality
and experience, what’s left for the COO will rarely be the same at any two
companies.

> understand the CEO’s role, responsibilities, preferences, style, and
> personality_._ Once you have a sense of the CEO, you’ll have a much better
> sense of what activities you’ll lead as their foil.

## The seven COO archetypes

Despite the fact that the COO role is far from consistent across companies,
Nathan Bennet and Stephen A. Miles found some themes as they explored the COO
role in [_Second in Command: The Misunderstood Role of the Chief Operating
Officer_ (HBR
2006)](https://hbr.org/2006/05/second-in-command-the-misunderstood-role-of-the-chief-operating-officer).

They identified seven COO archetypes:
1. **The executor.** They turn ideas and strategies into business realities.
2. **The change agent.** They are brought on to lead a specific change
   initiative, such as a turnaround or a planned expansion.
3. **The mentor.** They typically coach a young, founder CEO. They have deeper
   industry experience and apply that to co-lead with the CEO.
4. **The other half.** They are the ideal foil for the CEO–they’re great where
   the CEO is not as developed or interested.
5. **The partner.** They co-lead the company alongside the CEO.
6. **The heir apparent.** They are groomed to take over the top post in a
   succession plan.
7. **The MVP.** They are promoted from within in order to keep this valuable
   leader at the company.

The COOs I interviewed all defined their role as something very similar to “I
make things happen.” Some also described themselves as a “utility person”, “the
person that turns the idea into a business”, or “the person who keeps the
trains running.” These self-descriptions are consistent with “the executor” COO
archetype. Because I only interviewed six COOs, I’m can’t claim that all COOs
are executors. However, it does seem that most COOs are probably executors _at
a minimum,_ filling out into one of the other six archetypes depending on their
company and CEO context. Indeed, EY describes the COO as “the organization’s
go-to ‘fix-it’ person.”

## Making sense of the startup COO

In early stage companies, the CEO is very involved in all aspects of the
business. Because of this, it may not make sense to have a COO until a certain
level of scale is reached. I suspect it is after the company has developed a
repeatable sales process upon which they can start to build repeatable internal
processes. Once you reasonably expect to bring in a minimum amount of revenue,
you start to understand how much product to build, how much marketing it will
take to grow a healthy pipeline, and how much hiring you’ll need to do keep it
all running. Before (reasonable) predictability is in place, it may not make
sense to bring in another executive. More executives mean more salary paid out,
more equity doled out, and slower decision-making due to more voices in the
C-Suite. However, there are reasons to bring on a COO earlier than sales
predictability is reached:

1. The COO can help you reach product-market fit faster because of industry or
   product development expertise
2. The COO has more experience building businesses and will serve as the
   “mentor” to the less experienced CEO
3. If you started your business with them from the beginning (against the
   [hacker, hustler,
   hipster](https://www.forbes.com/sites/andyellwood/2012/08/22/the-dream-team-hipster-hacker-and-hustler/#48e20e552c85)
   advice). The COO title may help maintain a healthy co-founder relationship
   or convey clarity to outsiders
4. If the CEO is so focused on fundraising that an internal-facing right-hand
   person is critical

These four reasons match up with what I heard from the startup COOs I
interviewed. One COO co-founded his startup, telling me that he only has the
COO title for clarity and credibility with external audiences. In reality, he
manages business development, marketing, product, and operations: he is a
“partner” and “executor” COO. Another startup COO shared, “I’m COO by title. I
don’t really care what that means, I will be okay with a different title later.
I’m a generalist doing whatever is necessary”–here’s another partner/executor
startup COO. All four startup COOs I interviewed fell into this category.
Generalizing from a tiny sample, it seems that startup COOs are co-founder
generalists who partner with their CEO to turn the idea into a business.

## Words to operate by

I asked the COOs if they have a mantra that they operate by. A somewhat
out-there question, I wondered if they had a principle that they turn to in
times of ambiguity. Here’s what the COOs shared:

> “Make the decision and move on. There’s no time for a bunch of analysis, 80%,
> 60% is good enough. Very few decisions are company killing.” – startup COO,
> e-commerce

> “Enjoy this. I don’t want to feel depleted on a regular basis. We had a
> really rough few weeks where we thought we wouldn’t make it. So I decided
> that I need to enjoy this regardless, to change my mindset.” – startup COO,
> financial services

> “We build ugly shit that is functional. This happens in design, product
> development. We could make it 30% more pretty, but let’s get it out there.
> See what customers think.” –startup COO with product expertise, gaming

> “Enable the business–every single function I oversee is here to support the
> business.” –mid-size COO (150–200 employees), financial services

> “Assume the best. If you’re frustrated, stay calm and assume the best. We’re
> all in this together, trying to be our best selves. Eventually, you can
> figure anything out.” –mid-size COO (500+ employees), healthcare

> “Do good, don’t worry about leaving pennies on the table–worry about the next
> interaction with the entity.” –startup COO, e-commerce/gaming

## How to become a COO

The diversity of the COO role means there are many routes to the position. It
is still useful to see how others got there.

**Previous role could be… many things.** Of the six COOs I interviewed, only
one had served as COO previously. One had served as a CFO at several companies
before becoming the CFO/COO in her current position, albeit in very different
industries. Two had risen through product groups at technology companies. The
two working in financial services had worked in finance, sales, marketing, and
account management at banks or other financial companies.

**Generalist vs. Specialist.** You can go either route. As one COO I
interviewed put it,

> “Do what you like. Some people are super passionate about one thing: media,
> software, fashion, healthcare. That’s just not who I am, I’m more interested
> in the organization and the problem. And that is agnostic. You get a
> diversity of points of view, start to see patterns, compare and contrast,
> leverage different business models.”

**Master’s degrees.** Of the six COOs I interviewed, two have MBAs and three
have Master’s degrees in either accounting, economics, or international
affairs. According to the EY report [_DNA of a
COO_](https://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssetsPI/The_DNA_of_the_COO_-_Time_to_claim_the_spotlight/$FILE/DNA%20of%20the%20COO.pdf)
(2012), 54% of COOs have a Master’s degree or higher.

**A diverse set of skills.** According to the EY report, there are many skills
that successful COOs exhibit. Here’s one look at what’s needed.

![Skills needed to succeed as a COO](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arafatm/assets/main/img/so-you-want-to-be-a-coo/skills.png)

Note: percentage of respondents who have chosen 9 or 10 on a scale from 1= not
needed at all to 10 = absolutely needed.

## What COOs read

33% of COOs think their job has become more complex in recent years (EY, 2012).
Continuing to learn is very important to staying successful.

I asked each COO what books or podcasts have influenced their thinking. Here’s
a compiled list:

**Books**
* _10% Happier: How I Tamed the Voice in My Head, Reduced Stress Without Losing My Edge, and Found Self-Help That Actually Works — A True Story_ by Dan Harris
* _Blitzscaling_ by Reid Hoffman
* _Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World_ by Cal Newport
* _High Growth Handbook: Scaling Startups from 10 to 10,000 People_ by Elad B. Gil
* _Lean Product_ by Eric Ries
* _Let My People Go Surfing: The Education of a Reluctant Businessman_ by Yvon Chouinard
* _Smarter Faster Better: The Secrets of Being Productive in Life and Business_ by Charles Duhigg

* _Think and Grow Rich_ by Napolean Hill
* _Zero to One_ by Peter Thiel

**Podcasts**
* _How I Built This_ by Guy Raz
* _Masters of Scale_ by Reid Hoffman

After speaking to COOs and reading about the role in publications, I feel
confident that I can become a COO. If I wanted to become one soon, I would go
the startup route. It comes down to learning by serving in the role earlier or
learning best practices in bigger, more established companies. Given that I’m
18 years younger than the average COO (48), I’m tempted to go the big company
route–either by continuing in consulting with IDEO or going back into the
technology sector in a strategy and operations role. 

**Either way, I’m excited about what comes next. Whatever step I take is in the
right direction.**
