[I recently became an engineering
manager](https://betterprogramming.pub/my-engineering-manager-origin-story-ea51d5b4feb9),
and this book had a huge impact on my decision.

What I appreciated most is that Will Larson, the author, is highly opinionated
about various management topics. He clarifies a nebulous role through an
actionable set of systems.

There are parts of the book that are not super relevant for me yet (like being
a manager of managers), but I know I can come back to those parts if/when they
become relevant.

## #1 — Team Size

Will has a clear formula for what kind of manager you will likely be based on
your team size.
- “Balanced” manager— team of 6–8
- “Tech lead” manager — less than 4 reports
- “Coach” manager — greater than 8 reports

With 5 reports, I am not quite in the sweet spot but I find myself closer to
the “tech lead” manager role. I prefer that anyways, so I can spend more time
coding and be closer to implementation.

The “coach” manager, with more than 8 reports, is at the opposite end of the
spectrum. Will believes this team size is unsustainable and spreads the manager
too thin.

As I progress in my career, I’ll keep in mind how team size will affect my
efficacy as a manager and where I can make the greatest impact.

## #2 — Teams Should Both Innovate and Maintain

I love this principle.

Will advocates for a team to own both innovation (creation of net new features)
and maintenance (making sure existing systems don’t break).

I have worked at companies that have done the opposite and quickly develop two
factions with opposing goals.

With my team, I advocate for extreme ownership of all features we build
including maintenance.

## #3 — Four States of a Team

Every manager should have this diagram embedded in their brain:

![four states](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/0*Sb9H8B7H3mAt4Xkr.png)

Will provides an opinionated formula for how to handle each state:

### 1. Falling behind
- _State_: Team is working hard but backlog keeps growing. Morale is low.
- _Solution_: hire more people.

### 2. Treading water
- _State_: Critical work is getting done, but tech debt isn’t being paid down.
  Morale is ok.
- _Solution:_ Reduce concurrent or new work until the team can pay down tech
  debt.

### 3. Repaying debt
- _State:_ Able to spend time on technical debt. Each piece of technical debt
  solved unlocks more time to focus on tech debt (_debt-repayment snowball_)
  and innovation. Morale is good.

### 4. Innovating
- _State:_ The team has low tech debt and there is bandwidth to work on net-new
  features. Morale is high.

## #4 — “You Only Get Value From Projects When They Finish”

This is a simple but powerful concept.

Every engineer on your team may be working hard on individual projects, but
there is no value for the business until some of them are finished. Sometimes,
the individuals on your team can benefit from partnering up to accelerate
completion of projects.

From my experience, it is also possible to get incremental value even when a
project is not “finished.” This is done by incrementally releasing your feature
to users in phases. The downside is that this requires more planning.

## #5 — Developer Productivity System Diagram

![productivy system](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/0*70lj-1nokIBZmdaua)

This is my favorite diagram in the entire book.

It provides a way to debug/optimize constraints in your teams development
velocity.

For example, I noticed that the deploy rate was every 2 weeks for our mobile
application team. This made it so that 2 weeks worth of “Ready Commits” would
pile up before getting deployed. The sheer volume of code made it difficult for
us to QA and led to bugs or further delays to deployment.

The bottleneck was our slow deploy rate. As a solution, I proposed investing
time in a tool called [CodePush](https://microsoft.github.io/code-push/) that
would allow us to have “web-like” instant deployment for some of our Javascript
app features. It is now being integrated in our deployment process and should
unlock increased velocity.

## #6 — Become the Product Manager When You Don’t Have One

This is a critical concept for engineering managers to learn.

You will not always have a full team of designers, product managers, data
analysts, etc. Hopefully, that is a temporary situation. But when one or more
of these functions are missing, it is up to the engineering manager to put on
the relevant hats in order to unblock and ensure the team’s success.

You must blur the lines of your role when necessary.

## #7 — Strategies and Visions

The point of strategies and visions is to create alignment at scale.

This is more for managers of managers who do not have the time to meet with
every team or understand every roadmap but want to make sure their approach is
understood across teams.

Will outlines [the simplest formula for creating a strategy or
vision](https://lethain.com/good-engineering-strategy-is-boring/) that I have
ever read.

### **But first, what are they for?**

> “**Strategies** confirm you have a shared understanding of the current
> constraints and how to address them.”
> 
> **“Visions** ensure that you agree on long-term direction while preserving
> short-term flexibility.”
> 
> — Will Larson

### The Simplest Formula

1. **Strategy** — write 5 Design Docs (aka RFCs), and synthesize those docs
   into a strategy. This allows your strategy to be rooted in examples and not
   too abstract.
2. **Vision** — Write 5 strategies, and extrapolate them into a vision. Write a
   prediction of what will happen 2–3 years out as these 5 strategies play out.

It’s so simply brilliant!

Strategies and visions always felt like vague concepts to me. It was unclear to
me why leaders wrote them while I was an individual contributor. Probably
because they were too abstract or complex for me to understand.

Will emphasizes that good strategies and vision should be _boring_ and not to
be confused with innovation_._ They are tools to create alignment, and
unnecessarily complex or abstract ones will do just the opposite.

### Example Strategy

While I don’t have experience writing a vision doc, I have encountered several
RFCs that made it clear a strategy was needed and how we needed to write it.

I’ll break the strategy down using Will’s 3 steps for writing a strategy:
_diagnosis, policies, and actions._

- _Diagnosis_ — Currently, our frontend is distributed over several codebases,
  and I do not know where to add a new frontend application or feature. There
  is also a desire to consolidate these fragmented codebases, but there is
  disagreement about which ones to remove. In addition, there is disagreement
  about where to add new frontend features. I believe part of this is because
  ownership is unclear for these frontend systems.
- _Policies —_ Ownership and expertise will determine which codebase a feature
  will be migrated/added to. The two primary expertise categories are React
  developers and backend developers. The two broad categories of ownership are
  user-facing products vs. internal tooling/settings interfaces. React
  developers tend to own user-facing products, while backend developers tend to
  own internal tooling/settings interfaces. React developers will contribute to
  a single React codebase, while backend developers will contribute simpler
  static pages to a Ruby on Rails application.
- _Actions —_ This is simply applying the above policies. Will says this is
  straightforward to outline, but making sure others follow through is the hard
  part. The more specific, the better:

1. Is the feature user-facing and owned by product engineering? Implement it in
   the React codebase.
2. Is the feature for user settings or internal tooling? Implement it in the
   Ruby on Rails codebase.
3. Apply the same rules above for existing features that need to be migrated
   from other fragmented systems.

## #8 — Model, Document, and Share

This is a brilliant visualization of how to create change without (or with)
authority.

![change](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/0*4mo5iZXzzO-5IZfV.png)

Having worked as a growth engineer, a test/experiment-driven mindset is my
bread and butter when building products.

What I love about this diagram is that Will applies that same experimental
mindset to creating change within an organization.

The basic idea is to _model_ the change that you want, aka run an experiment at
a smaller scale, e.g. through leading by example or your team leading by
example.

At my recent company, I modeled behavior that led to strong outcomes. One
element of that was operating as a full-stack engineer and demonstrating
increased velocity and a stronger product mindset.

I then spent time _documenting_ what behaviors led to positive outcomes. This
process involved deep reflection and reverse engineering what I was doing to
create a repeatable framework.

As an engineering manager, I then spent time _sharing_ and socializing the
document I developed. In addition, my team further amplified this model by
becoming full-stack, product-minded engineers.

Modeling, documenting, and sharing allowed me and my team to positively impact
the organization without a top-level mandate.

## #9 — Decouple Participation From Productivity

This is a brilliant reminder to relentlessly prioritize and learn to say NO as
a manager.

There will be endless meetings, requests, emails, and messages that can suck up
all your time.

Will’s cautionary advice here is that attendance is not inherently valuable.
Being picky about where you are adding value or can gain value from meetings is
critical.

Something I do every morning is trying to identify the 4 or 5 decisions I can
make that will actually make a difference. This makes it easier to say no to
everything else.

## #10 — Internal Problems Can Be Traced Back to a Missing or Poor Relationship

The way I interpret this is that issues or conflicts are often due to missing
data between people.

Finding or fixing the missing or poor relationship fixes that communication
path to allow data to flow.

With repaired communication, two individuals or parts of the organization can
build a more **universal data set**.

This universal data set allows groups to be aligned and solve problems
agreeably.
