Title: Resources for Engineering Directors.

A few books that initially came to mind on the more general topic of “stuff
written for Directors rathern than line managers” were 
- [Team Topologies](https://www.amazon.com/Team-Topologies-Organizing-Business-Technology-ebook/dp/B09JWT9S4D/),
- the later sections of [The Manager’s Path](https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth-ebook/dp/B06XP3GJ7F/),
- and my own [An Elegant Puzzle](https://www.amazon.com/Elegant-Puzzle-Systems-Engineering-Management/dp/1732265186).

However, none of those book are particularly focused on the second, more
specific part of the question: how do you foster execution on teams you
indirectly manage?

There are three interesting pieces to think about here:
1.  Understand what’s happening on indirectly managed teams
2.  Adding things necessary for execution
3.  Remove things getting in the way of execution

## What’s actually happening?

Tools I’ve found useful here:

* **[Business Review Template](https://infraeng.dev/business-review-template/)** – these templates
  are great, and force folks to really analyze what’s happening on their team.
  They setup you, as a Director, to actually diagnose what’s happening on a
  team. They also give you a great chance to realign a team that’s going a bit
  sideways in their execution or interpretation of what really matters
* **Monthly or quarterly roadmap review** – what’s actually happening y’all,
  and what are the delivery dates? (This is tricky, [easy to end up in The Build Trap](https://www.amazon.com/Escaping-Build-Trap-Effective-Management/dp/149197379X).)
* **Skip-levels** – this matters even more as your organization grows beyond
  managing one layer of managers, but even with just one layer you’ll often
  find that individual contributors and managers have a very different
  perspective on things

## Adding missing pieces

Necessary pieces that are often missing:
* **Strategy** can be unclear, unstated, or unknown. If folks don’t know why a
  project matters and how it connects to other projects, it’s hard to move it
  forward. Some resources on strategy: [Writing engienering strategy from Staff
  Engineer](https://staffeng.com/guides/engineering-strategy), links in
  [Engineering Strategy section of StaffEng’s reading
  materials](https://staffeng.com/guides/learning-materials), Richard Rumelt’s
  [Good Strategy/Bad Strategy](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005331U7Q/)
* **Urgency** to complete the project. The one sentence version of driving
  urgency is: folks work urgently in areas that leadership says are important,
  connect to the strategy, and _pay active attention to_. This goes wrong a
  lot, though, whether it’s micromanagement or the forever unpopular, “do it
  because the CEO said so.” Probably worth a dedicated article of its own
* **Cross-functional priority** to complete the project. Particularly, the
  cross-functional priority to bypass permission gates, e.g. someone on Legal
  team to navigate contract language on a new feature.
* **Capacity to sustain execution** over the course of many projects,
  specifically adding headcount budget or equivalently reducing expectations
  work volume. Importantly, this is looking at [getting the team to a steady
  state of staffing for its ongoing
  workload](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/durably-excellent-teams/),
  not trying to change staffing strategy for a single, specific project. Teams
  are more durable than projects, inverting the two leaves you, and your team,
  with a mess

## Remove things getting in the way

Things that sometimes need to get removed:
* **Excessive visibility / misaligned priorities** – sometimes there are simply
  too many leaders providing direction to a team, e.g. three of four lightly
  misaligned executives driving a focal project, and you can help clean that up
  by being a trusted intermediate
* **Thrashing priorities** – if a team is shifting back and forth on focus or
  approach, figure out what’s causing that thrash and work to remove it. This
  is more often than not too many, somewhat misaligned, strategies, rather than
  the total absense of any strategy
* **Fixation on resources** – sometimes a team has convinced itself that it
  will be given permission to blamelessly fail as long as they say that they
  want more headcount staffing. This is a judgment call for you to make, but
  personally I’ve seen a good number of teams spend more time convincing
  themselves they need headcount without spending time trying to find a faster,
  shorter path to solve the problem with the team they have. Even if you’re
  evaluating increasing headcount, get the team out of the perspective of
  “waiting for staffing”
* **Weak or negative cross-team or cross-functional relationships** – sometimes
  a team isn’t working well with necessary partner teams for a given project,
  and you can debug and start the proces of cleaning that up
