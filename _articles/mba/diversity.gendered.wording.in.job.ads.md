Social dominance theory (Sidanius & Pratto, 1999) contends that
institutional-level mechanisms exist that reinforce and perpetuate existing
group-based inequalities, but very few such mechanisms have been empirically
demonstrated. 

We propose that gendered wording (i.e., masculine- and feminine-themed words,
such as those associated with gender stereotypes) may be a heretofore
unacknowledged, institutional-level mechanism of inequality maintenance. 

In the current research we identify an unacknowledged, institution level factor
that may serve to reinforce women’s underrepresentation in traditionally
male-dominated occupations: gendered wording used in job recruitment materials. 

Specifically, we investigate whether masculine-themed words (such as
competitive, dominate, and leader) emerge within job advertisements in
maledominated areas, and whether the mere presence of these masculine words
dissuade women from applying to the area because they cue that women do not
belong.

Moreover, gender differences in the linguistic style of everyday speech are
well documented (Carli, 1990; Lakoff, 1975).  Women, for example, use a more
communal style of speech than men (Brownlow, Rosamond, & Parker, 2003; Haas,
1979; Leaper & Aryes, 2007) and make more references to social and emotional
words (Newman, Groom, Handelman, & Pennebaker, 2008).

There is ample evidence to suggest that belongingness—feeling that one fits in
with others within a particular domain—affects people’s achievement motivation
specifically and engagement within a domain more generally, and that it can be
signaled by cues in the environment. Walton and Cohen (2007) provided some of
the most compelling evidence.

Men displayed only a slight preference for masculinely worded advertisements,
and gendered wording did not affect men’s anticipated feelings of
belongingness. 

Women anticipated less belongingness in jobs that were masculinely worded, and
these changes in anticipated belongingness mediated the effects on appeal.
