_We are in planning season at Digit. Like a number of other technology
companies, we use OKRs. I was puzzled by the wide range of OKR effectiveness at
different companies. My study of the nuances of different approaches led to the
conclusions outlined in this note. OKRs are incredibly useful but it takes a
long time for OKR usage to become effective. Shortcut your company‚Äôs learning
process by understanding and implementing the following ten ideas. If you find
them helpful, drop me a¬†[note](https://twitter.com/radoshi)._

OKRs stands for Objectives and Key Results. They capture two things:
1. **Objective**: The goal a company wants to achieve (‚ÄúWhat‚Äù)
2. **Key Results**: The path to achieving that goal (‚ÄúHow‚Äù)

OKRs are an invaluable management tool for organizations of all sizes. Used
properly, they allow an organization to unlock four superpowers:
1. **Focus**¬†and commit to priorities.
2. **Align**¬†and connect for teamwork.
3. **Accountability**¬†through tracking.
4. **Stretch**¬†to achieve the impossible.

[Measure What Matters](https://www.amazon.com/Measure-What-Matters-Google-Foundation/dp/0525536221/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=measure+what+matters&qid=1591233028&sr=8-3), John Doerr

**OKRs are a tool**. The act of using OKRs does not guarantee Google-like
performance, innovation, or market dominance. OKRs are not a strategy, nor do
they make up for lack of strategy. OKRs force a company or organization to
think rigorously, to hold themselves accountable, to stretch, and to learn and
grow. Persistent usage over time guarantees increased focus, alignment, and
execution. Here are 10 ideas to use them more effectively üëáüèΩ

## 1. Objectives must be Big and Motivating

A great, challenging goal is inspiring. It brings teams together. It ignites
that thing in us that led to human spaceflight and exploration of unknown
frontiers. Inspirational objectives are critical at the company level, since
company OKRs cascade down to teams and individuals. Everyone should feel proud
to accomplish their objectives and together achieve a higher goal.

    Objective: Win the Super Bowl
    
    KR1: Passing attack amasses 300+ yards per game.
    KR2: Defense allows fewer than 17 points per game.
    KR3: Special-teams unit ranks in top 3 in punts return coverage.

## 2. KRs must be measurable

There are three important components of a key result:
1. The **metric** by which you will measure progress.
2. Where you are **starting** and what the **goal** is.
3. When you‚Äôll be **done**. The time is assumed to be end of the execution
   period (quarter or half) if not mentioned explicitly.

For example, let‚Äôs say you want to reduce your AWS costs by improving server
efficiency.

    Objective: Reduce AWS costs.
    
    KR1: Increase server utilization.

How will we know whether we have achieved our OKR or not? When should we stop
working on this or work harder? The OKR could be rephrased to make it clearer:

    Objective: Reduce AWS costs from $100 to $80.
    
    KR1: Increase server utilization from 65% to 80% 
    by the end of the quarter.
    
## 3. Use binary KRs sparingly

A binary KR is one that is either done or not done. For example:

    Objective: Reduce AWS costs from $100 to $80.
    
    KR1: Turn on auto-scaling for all services 
    by the end of the quarter.

Binary KRs are measurable ‚Äî they were either accomplished or not ‚Äî but usually
need to be combined with quality counter-metrics to be effective. More on
metrics and counter-metrics below.

Another example of binary KRs are ‚ÄúShip KRs‚Äù. They are often used when rolling
out new features. Without baseline data, there is no way to measure or predict
how a feature will perform. The team can put in work to predict outcomes, but
sometimes, it is easier to ship something and see the impact. Ship KRs have
their place, use them with caution.

## 4. All Key Results must have dashboards

The natural consequence of measurability is the scoreboard. Every measurable KR
should have an associated dashboard. These need not be fancy ‚Äî an excel sheet
is sufficient to get started.

Some results are only measured fully in retrospect or take a while to get an
accurate read. Retention is an example of such a measure ‚Äî we don‚Äôt know
upfront which user will churn. In such cases, teams should use alternate
approaches, such as:
1. Create a *proxy ‚Äúoperational‚Äù metric* that correlates well with the goal
   metric. 1-day retention can be used for 30-day retention if we find that the
   bulk of churned users churn within a day.
2. Use a *forecasted or predicted number* as the operational metric. Monitor
   the predicted metric to keep the error within bounds.

## 5. Key Results must be exhaustive

Another common trap that leads to a feeling of inadequacy at the end of the
quarter is missing an objective despite accomplishing its KRs. Imagine we take
on a feature activation goal that ladders to some critical company objective.

    Objective: Increase usage of feature X from 100 DAU to 200 DAU by the end of the quarter.
    
    KR1: Improve activation funnel efficiency from 85% to 90% by August 1. 
    KR2: Improve feature X retention from 90% to 95% by September 1.
    
We get to the end of the quarter, both KRs are green, and feature usage hasn‚Äôt
gone up at all.

What if the lack of feature X had more to do with how you marketed it? If the
problem is at the top of the funnel, increasing funnel efficiency is unlikely
to achieve the goal.

*Missed KRs are abundantly evident in hindsight, but much harder to think of
ahead of time*. One approach is to ensure that the goal (or the first KR)
captures the intended outcome (100 DAU to 200 DAU) and let the team add KRs
along the way if enough progress is not being made.

## 6. Pair Metrics with Counter-Metrics

There is natural pressure and temptation to achieve progress at all costs.
There have been innumerable examples in the corporate world, with Enron and
Wells Fargo being the most recent, where the drive to achieve a particular
outcome, such as ‚ÄúOpen more accounts,‚Äù compromised the company‚Äôs core values.

To guard against such adverse outcomes, you can pair metrics with
counter-metrics. For example, Wells Fargo could have paired ‚Äúnumber of active
accounts‚Äù with defensive metrics such as ‚Äúeach account must be active,‚Äù ‚Äúeach
account must have a certain balance,‚Äù ‚Äúno more than X accounts per person in a
week.‚Äù

In product-feature land, there is a natural pairing of growth-based KRs and
quality-based KRs.

    KR1: Feature X will have 100 users by the end of the quarter.
    
    KR2: 7-day retention for Feature X will be 90%. 
    KR3: P0 and P1 bugs will be closed within a day.

## 7. Distinguish between Committed and Aspirational OKRs

OKRs are scored on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0. What‚Äôs a ‚Äúgood‚Äù score? Many tech
organizations believe the answer is 0.7, based directly on Google‚Äôs scoring
approach [whatmatters.org ‚Äî how to grade OKRs](https://www.whatmatters.com/faqs/how-to-grade-okrs/)

However, the Google scoring system applies to¬†**Aspirational OKRs**¬†‚Äî typically
Big, Hairy, Audacious Goals that you don‚Äôt know how to hit. You know it‚Äôs going
to be hard, and you‚Äôre likely to fall short. But if you don‚Äôt reach for the
moon, you‚Äôre never going to get there. The purpose of aspirational OKRs is to
stretch you, to motivate you to solve more significant problems and to think
differently.

In contrast, some OKRs are expected to be delivered in full. Doerr calls
these¬†**Committed OKRs**. For the business to succeed, for cross-functional
teams to depend on each other, these goals must be achieved in full. You are
pushing for complete success, not setting aspirational visions. The expected
score for these OKRs is 1.0, with low variance.

**Distinguishing between committed and aspirational OKRs is essential**. If a
team biases too much toward commitment, they may not stretch enough. If you go
all aspirational, you may not hit any goal. Leadership must make deliberate
choices about how their company should think about their OKR bias.

My current personal leaning is to bias toward committed OKRs for nearly
everything, with one or two aspirational OKRs for things that are truly
game-changing.

## 8. Cascade OKRs up, down, and laterally

High functioning organizations speak the language of OKRs. When you depend on
another team to hit your goal, *you should expect to see that dependency in the
other team‚Äôs OKRs*. If you don‚Äôt, your likelihood of failure has increased
significantly.

Similarly, *company Key Results often become Objectives for organizations
within the company*. *Organization Key Results become Objectives for individual
teams*.

*OKRs can also cascade upward*. For example, a team could discover that they
have no way of hitting their goals, given their level of staffing. They refuse
to take on the OKR, which in turn changes the OKRs above them, and so on.

**This cascade of OKRs through the organization is a critical step of aligning
the entire company**. While it may sound chaotic in theory, the company or
organization should quiesce in a week or two.

## 9. Personal OKRs are powerful. Use them to accelerate your career

Company and Team OKRs drive organizational alignment and focus. You can create
your personal OKRs too. While some will inevitably be congruent with your
team‚Äôs OKRs, there could be others that are about making progress in your
career or growing as an individual. Personal OKRs clarify your priorities with
your manager and your peers. They hold you accountable for accomplishing what
you set out to do.

I *think of Personal OKRs as writing my self-review, six months ahead of time*.
I have been creating personal OKRs, putting them into a document, and sharing
them with my manager for about six years. They have helped me be clear with my
manager about what constitutes success and failure, what is paramount in their
minds, and keeps me accountable for making progress. I strongly recommend doing
Personal OKRs and taking charge of your career.

When writing personal OKRs, you must¬†**focus on outcomes, not activities**.
This trap is avoided at the team and company level by making all KRs
measurable. However, when looking at personal OKRs, we start using language
like ‚ÄúParticipate in interviewing‚Äù or ‚ÄúBe a part of X team.‚Äù Consider
rephrasing into outcomes instead, such as ‚ÄúHire 3 engineers by the end of
quarter‚Äù or ‚ÄúConduct an average of 1 interview per week.‚Äù

## 10. Prefer a small number of tightly focused OKRs to a long list

OKRs should add focus. A large number of OKRs, whether individual or team,
imply a lack of focus. When push comes to shove, which OKR is going to drop?
Don‚Äôt bother adding OKR priorities ‚Äî that is simply a bandaid over the root
cause: you have too many OKRs.

OKRs should also **represent¬†commitment**. Picking one OKR means that we cannot
do something else. In your OKR discussions, you could include a list of things
you chose¬†_not¬†to do_ to illustrate an effort to add focus.

## Bonus: Effective OKR usage takes years

If you‚Äôre getting started with OKRs, know that your initial implementation will
suck. You may have too many, or they may not be measurable, chaos may reign as
OKRs cascade across the organization. Know that there is no pinnacle of OKR
usage ‚Äî Google struggles with them as much as a series-A startup. Their
struggles are different, and they‚Äôve had more than two decades to get it right.
But keep at it and make¬†_your_¬†version of OKRs better over time. Be patient.
