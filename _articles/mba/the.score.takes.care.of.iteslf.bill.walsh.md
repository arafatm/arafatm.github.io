### To Succeed You Must Fail

However, a resolute and resourceful leader understands that there are a
multitude of means to increase the probability of success.

## PART I My Standard of Performance: An Environment of Excellence

The ability to help the people around me self-actualize their goals underlines
the single aspect of my abilities and the label that I value most—teacher.
—BILL WALSH

### How to Know if You’re Doing the Job

“If you’re up at 3 A.M. every night talking into a tape recorder and writing
notes on scraps of paper, have a knot in your stomach and a rash on your skin,
are losing sleep and losing touch with your wife and kids, have no appetite or
sense of humor, and feel that everything might turn out wrong, then you’re
probably doing the job.”

### Coaches Aren’t Supposed to Cry: Survive One Minute at a Time

I must stand and fight again, stand and fight or it was all over.

Many can’t summon the strength; they can’t get up; their fight is over. Victory
goes to another, a stronger competitor.

MY FIVE DOS FOR GETTING BACK INTO THE GAME:
1. Do expect defeat.
2. Do force yourself to stop looking backward and dwelling on the professional “train wreck” you have just been in.
3. Do allow yourself appropriate recovery—grieving—time.
4. Do tell yourself, “I am going to stand and fight again,” with the knowledge
   that often when things are at their worst you’re closer than you can imagine
   to success.
5. Do begin planning for your next serious encounter.

MY FIVE DON’TS: 
1. Don’t ask, “Why me?” 
2. Don’t expect sympathy. 
3. Don’t bellyache. 
4. Don’t keep accepting condolences. 
5. Don’t blame others.

### My Standard of Performance: High Requirements for Actions and Attitudes

Regardless of your specific job, it is vital to our team that you do that job
at the highest possible level in all its various aspects, both mental and
physical (i.e., good talent with bad attitude equals bad talent).

### An Organization Has a Conscience

My Standard of Performance:
- Exhibit a ferocious and intelligently applied work ethic directed at continual
improvement;
- demonstrate respect for each person in the organization and the work he or she
does;
- be deeply committed to learning and teaching, which means increasing my own
expertise;
- be fair;
- demonstrate character;
- honor the direct connection between details and improvement, and relentlessly
seek the latter;
- show self-control, especially where it counts most—under pressure;
- demonstrate and prize loyalty;
- use positive language and have a positive attitude; take pride in my effort as an entity separate from the result of that effort;
- be willing to go the extra distance for the organization;
- deal appropriately with victory and defeat, adulation and humiliation (don’t get crazy with victory nor dysfunctional with loss);
- promote internal communication that is both open and substantive (especially under stress);
- seek poise in myself and those I lead;
- put the team’s welfare and priorities ahead of my own;
- maintain an ongoing level of concentration and focus that is abnormally high;
- make sacrifice and commitment the organization’s trademark.

If you were lucky enough to receive a 49er paycheck, it meant you were part of
an organization that had high expectations of itself and of you,

### Specifics of My New Standards

That perfect appearance was a predicate of perfect performance.

### The Prime Directive Was Not Victory

hiring personnel with four characteristics I value most highly: talent,
character, functional intelligence (beyond basic intelligence, the ability to
think on your feet, quickly and spontaneously), and an eagerness to adopt my
way of doing things, my philosophy.

### The Top Priority Is Teaching

Everybody was connected, each of us an extension of the others, each of us with
ownership in our organization.

Likewise, failure belongs to everyone. If you or a member of your team “drops
the ball,” everyone has ownership.

Leaders sometimes wonder why they or their organization fail to achieve
success, never seem to reach their potential. It’s often because they don’t
understand or can’t instill the concept of what a team is all about at its
best: connection and extension.

It’s why egotism can hurt group pride and unity so much. An individual who acts
like a big shot, as if he or she is solely responsible for what the team has
accomplished, has taken over ownership of the group’s achievement.

Michael Jordan being interviewed after a game. The Chicago Bull would tell the
media, “Scotty Pippen did a great job on defense; Dennis [Rodman] got a couple
of key rebounds, and our bench really picked up the slack in the third quarter
to give us a little breather. It was a great effort by everybody.”

### Winners Act Like Winners (Before They’re Winners)

The exceptional assembly line comes first, before the quality car.

Before you can win the fight, you’ve got to be in the fight.

### Seek to Be Near the Summit

### Establishing Your Standard of Performance

1. Start with a comprehensive recognition of, reverence for, and identification
   of the specific actions and attitudes relevant to your team’s performance
   and production.
2. Be clarion clear in communicating your expectation of high effort and
   execution of your Standard of Performance.
3. Let all know that you expect them to possess the highest level of expertise
   in their area of responsibility.
4. Beyond standards and methodology, teach your beliefs, values, and
   philosophy.
5. Teach “connection and extension.”
6. Make the expectations and metrics of competence that you demand in action
   and attitudes from personnel the new reality of your organization.

### How I Avoid Becoming a Victim of Myself

The key to performing under pressure at the highest possible level, regardless
of circumstance, is preparation in the context of your Standard of Performance
and a thorough assimilation by your organization of the actions and attitudes
contained within your philosophy of leadership.

Rather than feel that somehow I had to get a supreme effort from our
personnel—“try harder and harder”—I trusted that it was going to happen because
we had prepared thoroughly.

Some leaders drive their team past being able to perform with poise and
presence and into a state of anxiety where they’re not thinking as clearly as
they should.

## PART II Success Is Not Spelled G-E-N-I-U-S: Innovation, Planning, and Common Sense

### Opportunity Is in the Eye of the Beholder

Creating gold from dross is alchemy; making lemonade when you’re given lemons
is leadership; making lemonade when you don’t have any lemons is great
leadership.

### The West Coast Offense: From Checkers to Chess

They were locked into the past and unwittingly locking themselves out of the
future.

It’s often the case that a “game changer” takes a while to change the way the
game is played.

### Lessons of the Bill Walsh Offense

1. Success doesn’t care which road you take to get to its doorstep.
2. Be bold. Remove fear of the unknown—that is, change—from your mind.
3. Desperation should not drive innovation.
4. Be obsessive in looking for the upside in the downside.

> “What assets do we have right now that we’re not taking advantage of?”

### Welcome Skeptics to Your Team

perceptive, astute, and shrewd listener who did not fear change.

### Share the Glory

Few things offer greater return on less investment than praise—offering

### Write Your Own Script for Success: Flying by the Seat of Your Pants (Is No Way to Travel)

The local fire department was called in to help rescue a cat stuck up in a tall
tree.  During all the congratulations afterward, the fire truck drove off and
ran over the cat.

You must continually be anticipating and preparing to deal with what management
expert Peter Drucker characterized as “foul weather.”

but I would expand Drucker’s category to include “fine weather”—what you’ll do
if the cat is rescued.

to be prepared I had to factor in every contingency: good weather, bad weather,
and everything in between.

You must envision the future deeply and in detail—creatively—so that the
unforeseeable becomes foreseeable. Then you write your script for the
foreseeable.

it was almost impossible for me to make quick and correct decisions in the
extreme emotional and mental upheaval that accompanied many situations during a
game.

I don’t care how smart or quick-witted you are, what your training or intellect
is; under extreme stress you’re not as good.

Contingency planning cleared away the clouds and removed the shadows. It
brought clarity to what could be a confusing situation.

> A leader must see the forest and the trees.

Hearing someone described as being able to “fly by the seat of his pants”
always suggests to me a leader who hasn’t prepared properly and whose pants may
soon fall down.

it’s a macho attitude to believe, “I’m at my best when all hell breaks loose.”
But it’s usually not true; you cannot think as clearly or perform as well when
engulfed by stress, anxiety, fear, tension, or turmoil.

When it counts is before all hell breaks loose.

### Control What You Can Control: Let the Score Take Care of Itself

scripting, adapted to your own environment in your own way, can have the same
tremendous benefit for you that it did for me, and I offer this summary as a
good point of reference:

1. Flying by the seat of your pants precedes crashing by the seat of your pants.
2. Planning for foul or fair weather, “scripting” as it applies to your organization, improves the odds of making a safe landing and is a key to success. When you prepare for everything, you’re ready for anything.
3. Create a crisis-management team that is smart enough to anticipate and plan for crises.
4. All personnel must recognize that your organization is adaptive and dynamic in facing unstable “weather.” It is a state of mind.
5. In the face of massive and often conflicting pressures, an organization must be resolute in its vision of the future and the contingent plans to get where it wants to go.
6. You bring on failure by reacting in an inappropriate manner to pressure or adversity. Your version of “scripting” helps ensure that you will offer the appropriate response in a professional manner, that you will act like a leader.

### Protect Your Blind Side: The Leadership Two-Step: Move/Countermove

When Lawrence Taylor entered the NFL, not everyone understood how much his
presence changed things. I did.

all solutions are only temporary. They last until your competitor makes a
meaningful countermove to your own countermove. At which time it’s your turn
again.

The key is to quickly recognize the nature of the threat and then to creatively
and expeditiously respond to it. Otherwise, the game will be over before it
begins.

### The Archaeology of Leadership: Seek Reward in the Ruins

Every leader does year-end reviews and comes to conclusions of one sort or
another.

My observation is that two leaders—coaches—looking at the same information will
not see the same thing. The one who’s a more skilled analyst, who digs deeper
and wider, will benefit more.

### THE WALSH WAY The Problem Solver Mike White, Assistant Coach, San Francisco 49ers

Every organization has them, influential people who’ve got your back—or are
putting a knife in it.

one end of the scale there were locker-room leaders who were positive and
supportive and at the other end influential players who were very negative.
Most important, he understood that all the guys in the middle could go one way
or the other; they were up for grabs.

## PART III Fundamentals of Leadership: Concepts, Conceits, and Conclusions

### “I Am the Leader!”

others follow you based on the quality of your actions rather than the
magnitude of your declarations.

It’s like announcing, “I am rich!” when you’re broke.

### The Common Denominator of Leadership: Strength of Will

They simply would not quit in their effort to install their own system, to push
forward with their plan, not someone else’s or a committee’s.

Some leaders are volatile, some voluble; some stoic, others exuberant; but all
successful leaders know where we want to go, figure out a way we believe will
get the organization there (after careful consideration of relevant available
information), and then move forward with absolute determination.

My ultimate job, and yours, is not to give an opinion. Everybody’s got an
opinion. Leaders are paid to make a decision.

The difference between offering an opinion and making a decision is the
difference between working for the leader and being the leader.

a problem this prerequisite leadership trait—strength of will—can pose, namely,
the problem of determining when “my way” is the wrong way.

### Be Wrong for the Right Reasons

It’s a delicate balance: You must persevere to achieve anything of import, but
at what stage does perseverance become pigheadedness?

was staying with a bad plan because my ego was committed to the stupid
challenge I had made

New Coke was introduced in April and taken off the shelves in July.

A leader must be keen and alert to what drives a decision, a plan of action.

One of the great leadership challenges is to recognize when hubris has you in
its grip before it is too late to change.

### Protect Your Turf

Leaders who don’t understand what their territory is and how to protect it will
soon find themselves with no turf to protect.

### Be a Leader—Twelve Habits Plus One

When you fall prey to the naysayers who eagerly provide you with all the
reasons why you won’t succeed, why you can’t win, and why you should quit, you
have lost the winner’s edge.

Twelve habits I have identified over the years that will make you be a better
leader:
1. Be yourself.  If you’re faking it, you’ll be found out.
2. Be committed to excellence.
3. Be positive.
  - spent far more time teaching what to do than what not to do;
  - encouraging individuals than criticizing them;
  - building up than tearing down.
4. Be prepared. (Good luck is a product of good planning.)
  - get ready for expected situations—events
  - Equally important, plan and prepare for the unexpected.
  - “What happens when what’s supposed to happen doesn’t happen?”
5. Be detail-oriented.
  - High performance is achieved small step by small step through painstaking dedication to pertinent details.
  - Caution: Do not make the mistake of burying yourself alive in those details.
6. Be organized.  A symphony will sound like a mess without a musical score
7. Be accountable.  Excuse making is contagious.
8. Be near-sighted and far-sighted.  Keep everything in perspective while
  - simultaneously concentrating fully on the task at hand.  
  - how they affect the organization’s performance
  - not how they affect you or your feelings.
9. Be fair.  
  - Be clear in your own mind as to what you stand for. 
  - And then stand up for it.
0. Be firm.
1. Be flexible.  
 - Consistency is crucial, but you must be quick to adjust to new challenges
2. Believe in yourself.  belief derives from expertise.
3. Be a leader.

### Sweat the Right Small Stuff: Sharp Pencils Do Not Translate into Sharp Performance

Coach George Allen head coach of the Washington Redskins, sent a staff member
out to the Coliseum for an entire afternoon to chart the movement of the sun
during the hours when the game would be played.

While it is critically important to concentrate on the smallest relevant
aspects of your job without losing sight of the big picture, it is easy to
become so completely overwhelmed by ongoing setbacks that you start focusing on
issues completely extraneous

“There’ll be plenty of time for pencils, parties, and socializing when I lose
my job, because that’s what’s going to happen if I continue to avoid the hard
and harsh realities of doing my job.”

Ten additional nails you can pound into your professional coffin:
1. Exhibit patience, paralyzing patience.
2. Engage in delegating—massive delegating—or conversely, engage in too little
   delegating.
3. Act in a tedious, overly cautious manner. 
4. Become best buddies with certain employees.
5. Spend excessive amounts of time socializing with superiors or subordinates.
6. Fail to continue hard-nosed performance evaluations of
   longtime—“tenured”—staff members, the ones most likely to go on cruise
   control, to relax.
7. Fail to actively participate in efforts to appraise and acquire new hires.
8. Trust others to carry out your fundamental duties.
9. Find ways to get out from under the responsibilities of your position, to
   move accountability from yourself to others—the blame game.
0. Promote an organizational environment that is comfortable and laid-back in
   the misbelief that the workplace should be fun, lighthearted, and free from
   appropriate levels of tension and urgency.

### Good Leadership Percolates Down

trademark of a well-led organization in sports or business is that it’s
virtually self-sustaining and self-directed—almost autonomous.

an organization is crippled if it needs to ask the leader what to do every time
a question arises.

“Commit, explode, recover (if you’re wrong)!” which was shorthand for having a
plan of attack, executing it suddenly and powerfully, and then reacting quickly
and intelligently to the results of what you’ve done.

If everything goes great when you’re around but slows or stops in its tracks
when you’re not there, you are not fulfilling your responsibilities. Your
leadership has not percolated down.

### Nameless, Faceless Objects

Demonizing the competition is a common but contrived method for stirring up
emotions.

a player needed me to light a fire under him by turning the other team into a
demon, he was lacking something I couldn’t give him.

Of course, there are exceptions to every rule.

### The Rules May Change, But the Game Goes On: I Strike Out the First Time, Not the Second

don’t assume because of odd circumstances that everything will somehow sort
itself out. Rather, play for keeps all the time. The clock never stops running;
there is never a “time-out” when what you do is somehow less meaningful.

### You Must Have a Hard Edge

a leader needs a very hard edge inside; it has to lurk in there somewhere and
come out on occasion.

You must be able to make and carry out harsh and, at times, ruthless decisions
in a manner that is fast, firm, and fair.

### The Inner Voice vs. the Outer Voice

Leadership is expertise. It is not rhetoric or cheerleading speeches.

because I could function under stress. I was clearheaded and made sound
decisions.

For members of your team, you determine what their inner voice says. The
leader, at least a good one, teaches the team how to talk to themselves.

four messages in common:
1. We can win if we work smart enough and hard enough.
2. We can win if we put the good of the group ahead of our own personal
   interests.
3. We can win if we improve. And there is always room for improvement.
4. I know what is required for us to win. I will show you what it is.

### Montana’s Leadership by Example: Cool, Calm, and Collected

Of course, Joe had the talent, but talent alone won’t make you a leader

Despite the fact that he was the starting quarterback, with all of the
trappings that come with that position, he never played favorites or believed
that a person’s reputation, status, or credentials entitled him to special
treatment.

you were treated as an equal.

Joe didn’t have to talk the talk because he walked the walk.

proved you don’t need to shout, stomp, or strut to be a great leader—just do
the job and treat people right.

employ an approach that is based on the following principles:
1. Treat people like people.
2. Seek positive relationships through encouragement, support, and critical
   evaluation.
3. Afford everyone equal dignity, respect, and treatment.
4. Blend honesty and “diplomacy.”
5. Allow for a wide range of moods, from serious to very relaxed, in the
   workplace depending on the circumstances.
6. Avoid pleading with players to “get going” or trying to relate to them by
   adopting their vernacular. Strong leaders don’t plead with individuals to
   perform.
7. Make each person in your employ very aware that his or her well-being has a high priority with the organization
8. Give no VIP treatment.
9. Speak in positive terms about former members of your organization.
0. Demonstrate interest in and support for the extended families of members of the organization.
1. Communicate on a first-name basis without allowing relationships to become buddy-buddy.
2. Don’t let differences or animosity linger.

Joe Montana threw three interceptions against Cincinnati in the first half.  I pulled him over and asked him innocently, “How’s it going out there, Joe?” He got my joke, and I think it took off some of the pressure and anger he had at himself.

General George S. Patton, from “Letter of Instruction Number 1” (from War As I
Knew It), offered six key dictates.
1. Remember that praise is more valuable than blame.
2. Use every means before and after combat to tell troops what they are going
   to do and what they have done.
3. Discipline is based on pride in the profession [my italics] of arms, on
   meticulous attention to details, and on mutual respect and confidence.
4. Officers must assert themselves by example and by voice.
5. General officers must be seen in the front line during action.
6. There is a tendency for the chain of command to overload junior officers by
   excessive requirements in the way of training and reports.

You will alleviate this burden by eliminating non-essential demands.

### Don’t Let Anybody Call You a Genius

an inflated label like “Genius,” or any other form of hyperbole, comes with a
big downside—that

create both external and internal problems, making your life and job a lot
tougher than they already are.

The real damage occurs when you start to believe that future success will come
your way automatically because of the great ability of this caricature you have
suddenly become,

that the hard work and applied intelligence you utilized initially are not as
crucial as they once were.

### The Leverage of Language

You demonstrate a lack of assuredness when you talk constantly in negatives.

very sharp in criticizing a player or coach, but I always made an effort to
counter it by following up the barbs with more upbeat input immediately
afterward.

When I criticized or gave feedback to someone, it wasn’t defeatist. It was
always focused on the here and now

### Don’t Beat Around the Bush (When Describing a Bush)

clear, specific, and comprehensive without an ounce of ambiguity.

Brown would start each season with the phrase, “Gentlemen, let’s set the record
straight,” and then proceed to do exactly that. Step by step by step, specific
after specific, he would cover every aspect of being on the Cincinnati Bengals

Needless to say, he continued with this kind of direct and clear communication
in the months that followed—in practice, during games, and elsewhere.

Employees can thrive in an environment where they know exactly what is expected
of them—even when those expectations are very high.

don’t be subtle, don’t be coy, don’t be vague.

### Don’t Mistake Grabbin’ for Tackling

Lombardi could see that his defensive players were not getting it done, were
not really doing the hard job of tackling runners.

He let them know that “grabbin’ ” was not their job description and simply
going through the motions was going to get them beat.

John Wooden summed it up like this: “Don’t mistake activity for achievement.”

### Communication Creates Collaboration: Big Ears Are Better Than Big Egos

Quality collaboration is only possible in the presence of quality
communication;

“having big ears”—the skill of being a great listener—is the first law of good
communication.

(The second law is “When you’re not listening, ask good questions.”)

An individual doesn’t need to be an expert to ask an intelligent question or
offer useful insights. A sentence beginning with the words “This may sound
dumb, but . .

Sitting in your office with the door closed and issuing edicts from on high is
not communication, and is certainly not collaborative leadership.

You should be willing to go to someone’s office or desk and help him or her do
his or her job.  “management by walking around.” 

if your left hand doesn’t know what your right hand is doing, you’ll get
knocked out.

### Be a King Without a Crown

coach John Wooden has always urged, “Be more concerned with finding the right
way than in having it your way.”

A leader who just wants to hear “yes” is like a child who only wants to eat
candy.

setting aside your ego, resisting the temptation to let the world know how
smart you are or think you are.

If you’re doing your job, the team will recognize your abilities.

someone told me that leadership is as easy as one, two, three, I’d reply, “Only
if the one, two, and three are as follows: 1. Listen 2. Learn 3. Lead”

### Create Uncertainty

comfort zone is dangerous because it creates an often almost imperceptible
lowering of intensity, focus, and energy, which leads directly to reduced
effort, additional mistakes, and diminished performance.

if you’re predictably difficult or predictably easygoing, others become
predictably comfortable.

feeling comfortable is first cousin to being complacent.

### Play with Poise

Leadership requires poise under pressure.

Knowing in advance what I would do in various situations—for example, scripting
a game—was insurance that I could stay poised when it counted.

### Teaching Defines Your Leadership

There are winners, and there are people who would like to be winners but just
don’t know how to do it.

#### 1. Passion is not just having a desire to do the job of teaching.

Passion is a love for the act of teaching itself—believing in your heart that
it is not a means to an end, but an end in itself.

#### 2. Expertise is the inventory of knowledge and experience you possess on a particular subject.

The greater your expertise, the greater your potential to teach, the stronger
and more productive you can be as a leader.

good rule of thumb: “The more you know, the higher you go.”

#### 3. Communication is the ability to organize and then successfully convey your informed thoughts.

Many mistakenly believe that just presenting facts—information—is teaching.
Successful teaching is a two-way process.

I have spent literally thousands of hours in front of an overhead projector
diagramming and explaining plays to a bunch of easily bored athletes

I did it with facial and body language—moving assuredly and with energy,

“Guys, this one should knock ’em on their asses!”

started and finished my description with nothing but optimism, enthusiasm, and
belief. Never a caveat, no “ifs,” no hesitancy.

#### 4. Persistence is essential because knowledge is rarely imparted on the first attempt.

practices to facilitate what you do as a leader who is a great teacher:
1. Use straightforward language.
2. Be concise.
3. Account for a wide range of difference in knowledge, experience, and
   comprehension among members of your organization.
4. Account for some members of the group being more receptive and ready to
   learn than others
5. Be observant during your comments.
6. Strongly encourage note taking.
7. Employ a somewhat unpredictable presentation style.
8. Organize with logical, sequential building blocks in your communication.
9. Encourage appropriate audience participation.
10. Use visual aids.
11. Remember Sun-tzu: “With more sophistication comes more control.”

### The Thrill of Teaching

Companies led by good teachers, those with passion, expertise, communication
skills, and persistence, do very well.

He’d say to us coaches, “I’m going to yell at you in front of the players once
in awhile. When that happens, don’t get upset with me. Your players will work
even harder for you because they’ll feel sorry for you.”

He wanted input, but once the decision was made, he wanted it carried out
precisely.

## PART IV Essentials of a Winning Team: People, Priorities, and Performance

### Money Talks. Treating People Right Talks Louder.

From the first day I took over, we treated people right. More than money,
that’s what made the San Francisco 49ers a first-class organization

“Fella, I’m not mad at you. I’m mad at the SOB who hired you.”

an organization is only as good as the people who work there

and that the leader determines who works there.

My checklist of personal qualities—assets—in potential staff members:
1. A fundamental knowledge of the area he or she has been hired to manage.
   often we are tempted to hire simply on the basis of friendship or other
   user-friendly characteristics. They can be important. Expertise is more
   important.  
2. A relatively high—but not manic—level of energy and enthusiasm and a
   personality that is upbeat, motivated, and animated.  A negative,
   complaining staff member will be emulated by those he or she is in charge
   of. So will a positive go-getter.  
3. The ability to discern talent in potential employees
4. An ability to communicate
5. Unconditional loyalty to both you and other staff members.

checklist for keeping good staff members on the same page:
1. You must establish clear parameters for your staff regarding the overall
   method by which you expect things to be done.
2. Any philosophical differences that crop up must be identified and addressed
   by you in private meetings with the individual(s).
3. You must recognize that staff members may work in different ways, using
   approaches that are at variance with yours.
4. To ensure unanimity throughout the staff, make unannounced visits to various
   department meetings.
5. Don’t cede inordinate power or control to a staff member simply because you
   are relieved to have an experienced and proven performer come on board.
6. Sometimes a staff member may intentionally teach a philosophy that is at
   odds with your code of conduct, in the belief that it conforms to your
   philosophy.
7. Be alert for those staff members who seek to use their position to teach and
   express their personal beliefs.  Politics and religion are the two most
   common areas.
8. Remember Mike Ditka’s comment on leadership after his Bears won a Super Bowl
   championship: “Personal contact is part of hands-on management. Go to the
   other guy’s office; tell him what you have in mind

### The Over and Under: The Art of Managing Confidence

More people are more familiar with losing than with winning.

As with losing, there is fallout from success, and many of the symptoms are the
same. The only difference is that you go down with a smile on your face instead
of a frown.

being knocked off balance emotionally and mentally—is one of the fundamental
reasons it is so difficult to continue winning;

Success Disease—overconfidence is a major symptom—can happen in any profession

> Mastery requires endless remastery. In fact, I don’t believe there is ever
> true mastery. It is a process, not a destination.

Fend off the fallout from achievement; specifically, Success Disease:
1. Formally celebrate and observe the momentous achievement—the victory—and
   make sure that everyone feels ownership in it.
2. Allow pats on the back for a limited time.  Then formally return to business
   as usual 
3. Be apprehensive about applause.  
4. Develop a plan for your staff that gets them back into the mode of operation
   that produced success in the first place.  
5. Address specific situations that need shoring up; focus on the mistakes that
   were made and things that were not up to snuff in the success.  
6. Be demanding.  Do not relax. Hold everyone to even higher expectations.  
7. Don’t fall prey to overconfidence so that you feel you can or should make
   change for the sake of change.  
8. Use the time immediately following success as an opportunity to make hard
   decisions, 
9. Never fall prey to the belief that getting to the top makes everything easy.  
10. Recognize that mastery is a process, not a destination.

in the history of the Super Bowl, no team has been able to win three in a row.

### The Under: Strive to Be a One-Point Underdog

instill in each member of our group the belief that, regardless of the
opponent, we were a one-point underdog, that the upcoming team was just a
little better than we were or had motivation enough to really raise their level
of play—the

### Seek Character. Beware Characters.

capable of doing it under losing circumstances.

It takes extraordinary fortitude to stay with it when times are bad.

### A Big Cheer for a Big Ego

Don’t let anybody tell you that a big ego is a bad thing. Tiger Woods, Bill
Gates, Warren Buffett, and Cal Ripken Jr. have lots of ego, and so does anyone
anywhere who is dedicated to taking his or her talent as far as it will go.

Unfortunately, a strong, healthy ego often becomes egotism.

Psychologists suggest that there is a strong link between ego and
competitiveness.

when I sense ego turning into egotism, I sit down and talk with the individual
to help him understand his problem, to recognize why he’s on the team, to see
if we can’t get his perspective back in balance and minimize his inflated sense
of value to the organization.

Most of those who strutted around were the less intelligent players. And being
less intelligent, they couldn’t understand my message and ended up being
isolated by their teammates—ostracized

### The Bottom 20 Percent May Determine Your Success

At the beginning of each year’s training camp, I made the following promise to
our team: “Every single one of you guys will have at least one chance to win a
game for us. I ask you to prepare for that opportunity with the attitude that
it’s a certainty, not a possibility.

Those comments were aimed specifically at the so-called bottom 20 percent of
our team—the

the backups, “benchwarmers,” and special role players,

others with plenty of playing time didn’t need me to remind them

the bottom 20 percent who were more likely to feel overlooked,

the bitching of the bottom 20 percent often overshadows the positive enthusiasm
of the other 80 percent.

whiners seem to have a disproportionate impact.

### Avoid the Dance of the Doomed

a “dance of death” occurs when a wildebeest is run into exhaustion by a lion.
Waiting to be killed as the lion circles, the wildebeest meekly submits to its
fate—head drooping, shoulders slumped, eyes glazed over.

“Fellas, I guess we’re gonna lose today. How do you want to do it?” They knew
what I meant. I was asking them to stand up and fight and if they lost, at
least to lose with dignity.

I care a lot more about how we lose than if we lose.

Even in the worst circumstance (and this was pretty close to being the worst),
do not unravel mentally or emotionally; continue to fight and execute well,
even if the cause appears to be lost; act like professionals.

Your competitor must never look at you across the field, conference table, or
anywhere else and conclude, “I not only beat you, I broke your spirit.”

### Use the Four Most Powerful Words

having the courage to say, “I believe in you,” in whatever words and way are
comfortable for you. These four words—or their equivalents—constitute the most
inspirational message a leader can convey.

Nobody will ever come back to you later and say “thank you” for expecting too
little of them.

### Extreme Effort Requires Extreme Prudence

One of your great challenges is finding the middle ground between the
well-being of the people who work with you and the achievement of your goals.

If your team is constantly working on adrenaline, in a crisis mode, running as
hard as they can, they become vulnerable. When an emergency arises, when the
competition suddenly presents an unexpected threat, your team has no next level
to step up to, no reserves to draw on.

We got beat because we were beat.

What’s difficult to do is recognize when extra effort, extreme exertion,
working “as hard as possible” starts to produce diminishing returns.

### The Bubba Diet: You Can’t Transplant Willpower

we must try our best to encourage, support, and inspire, but
eventually—ultimately—people must do it for themselves.

### “Conventional Wisdom” Is an Oxymoron

trusting your own judgment enough to be resourceful, innovative, and
imaginative. It means resisting the herd mentality.

Conventional thinking didn’t produce Jerry Rice.

necessary to initiate communication after a conflict, even if the other person
had misunderstood you or wrongfully ridiculed you.

negative relationships have ongoing negative consequences.

transformed from an adversary into an advocate.

by minimizing the forces working against you, you do away with resultant
distractions and free your mind and conserve your energy to focus on your work.

### Hold on Until Help Arrives: Keep Your Boss in the Loop

This included providing him with a budget manual (thick), an operations manual
(thick), a personnel manual (thick), an overall set of job descriptions that
included the specific job of each player and my evaluation of that individual
(thick), and a detailed listing of my performance goals and expectations (even
thicker). On and on and on. Paper. Paper. Paper. The information was not
frivolous “filler,” but substantive and sizable.

I wanted the owner (and his advisers) to understand that I was applying maximum
effort and paying attention to every single solitary detail

Positive results—winning—count most. But until those results come through your
door, a heavy dose of documentation relating to what you’ve done and what
you’re doing, planning to do, and hoping to do may buy you just enough extra
time to actually do it.

Whether they read it or not, flood your superiors with information that is
documented—projections,

### Keep Your Eye on the Ball

1. Concentrate on what will produce results rather than on the results, the
   process rather than the prize.  
2. Exhibit an inner toughness emanating from four of the most effective
   survival tools a leader can possess: expertise, composure, patience, and
   common sense.  
3. Maintain your level of professional ethics and all details of your own
   Standard of Performance.  
4. Don’t isolate yourself.  
5. Don’t let the magnitude of the challenge take you away from the incremental
   steps necessary to effect change.  
6. Exude an upbeat and determined attitude.  
7. Hold meetings with staff educating them on what to expect; 
8. Don’t label some concept or new plan the thing that will “get us back on
   track.” 
9. Ensure that an appropriate level of courtesy and respect is extended to all
   members of the organization.  
10. Don’t plead with employees to “do better.” 
11. Avoid continual threatening or chastising.  
12. Deal with your immediate superior(s) on a one-to-one, ongoing basis.

### Make Your Own Mentors: A PhD from the University of Paul Brown, et al.

We learn in many ways from many sources. One of the most powerful is a mentor,

any head coach or general manager I worked for thought of himself as my mentor.
Nevertheless, they served as such because I consciously assimilated as much of
their great know-how as I could—asking

asking questions about the logic supporting their decisions; analyzing their
behavior in managing others; drawing my own conclusions about how to
incorporate it into my own approach
