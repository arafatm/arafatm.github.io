Jay Shetty on karma from a Vedic perspective `"Karma is the law of every action has an equal and opposite reaction; that anything we receive in life is based on the intention and the attention with which we made a decision." ... "because the intention and the attention are not in the right place and therefore you get a result. [You don't get hurt because you hurt someone, you get hurt] because the intention and the attention at that moment in time is misaligned. Similarly, when you go through a relationship and something terrible happens, like someone cheats on you, it's not because you cheated on someone, it's because when you look back, you know that you let some red flags slide. You know that you weren't observant, you didn't listen to your intuition. You know that there were parts of them that you could tell that they were ready to do something like that, but you were ignorant, or you were so negligent you trusted them blindly. You didn't let them earn your trust, you just gave your trust away. You didn't let them build your trust, you just trusted them because you thought they were amazing and they were wonderful and they were kind but you got blind in love".`

This occurs because the majority that favors C is misleadingly divided among different groups.`
https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1225561131122597896.html `Cultural Parasitism: An ideology parasitizes the mind, changing the host’s behavior so they spread it to other people. Therefore, a successful ideology (the only kind we hear about) is not configured to be true; it is configured only to be easily transmitted and easily believed.`
https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1225561131122597896.html `Cumulative Error: Mistakes grow. Beliefs are built on beliefs, so one wrong thought can snowball into a delusional worldview. Likewise, as an inaccuracy is reposted on the web, more is added to it, creating fake news. In our networked age, cumulative errors are the norm.`
https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1225561131122597896.html `Dunning-Kruger Effect: Awareness of the limitations of cognition (thinking) requires a proficiency in metacognition (thinking about thinking). In other words, being stupid makes you too stupid to realize how stupid you are.`
https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1225561131122597896.html `Emergence: When many simple objects interact with each other, they can form a system that has qualities that the objects themselves don’t. Examples: neurons creating consciousness, traders creating the stock-market, simple mathematical rules creating "living" patterns.`
https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1225561131122597896.html `Emotive Conjugation: Synonyms can yield positive or negative impressions without changing the basic meaning of a word. Example: someone who is obstinate (neutral term) can be "headstrong" (positive) or "pig-headed" (negative). This is the basis for much bias in journalism.`
https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1225561131122597896.html `Ergodicity: A die rolled 100 times has equal probabilities to 100 dice rolled once; rolling a die is "ergodic". But if the die gets chipped after 10 throws so it’s likelier to roll 4, then 1 die 100 times =/= 100 dice once (non-ergodic). Many treat non-ergodic systems as ergodic.`
https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1225561131122597896.html `Focusing Illusion: Nothing is ever as important as what you’re thinking about while you’re thinking about it. E.g. worrying about a thing makes the thing being worried about seem worse than it is. As Marcus Aurelius observed, "We suffer more often in imagination that in reality.".`
https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1225561131122597896.html `Golden Hammer: When someone, usually an intellectual who has gained a cultish following for popularizing a concept, becomes so drunk with power he thinks he can apply that concept to everything. Every mention of this concept should be accompanied by a picture of @nntaleb.`
https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1225561131122597896.html `Goodhart’s Law: When a measure becomes a goal, it ceases to become a measure. E.g. British colonialists tried to control snakes in India. They measured progress by number of snakes killed, offering money for snake corpses. People responded by breeding snakes & killing them.`
https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1225561131122597896.html `Gurwinder Principle: It is often necessary to eat chocolate cake.`
https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1225561131122597896.html `Halo Effect: When a person sees an agreeable characteristic in something or someone, they assume other agreeable characteristics. Example: if a Trump supporter sees someone wearing a MAGA cap, he’s likely to think that person is also decent, honest, hard-working, etc.`
https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1225561131122597896.html `Legibility: We see a complex natural system, assume that because it *looks* messy that it must be disordered, then impose our own order on it to make it "legible". But in removing the messiness we remove essential components of the system that we couldn’t grasp, and it fails.`
https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1225561131122597896.html `Limited Hangout: A common tactic by journos & politicians of revealing intriguing but relatively innocent info to satisfy curiosity and prevent discovery of more incriminating info. E.g. a politician accused of snorting cocaine may confess to having smoked marijuana at college.`
https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1225561131122597896.html `Loki’s Wager: Fallacy where someone tries to defend a concept from criticism, or dismiss it as a myth, by unduly claiming it cannot be defined. E.g. "God works in mysterious ways" (god of the gaps), "race is biologically meaningless" (Lewontin’s fallacy).`
https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1225561131122597896.html `Matthew Principle: Advantage begets advantage, leading to social, economic, and cultural oligopolies. The richer you are the easier it is to get even richer, the more recognition a scientist receives for a discovery the more recognition he’ll receive for future discoveries, etc.`
https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1225561131122597896.html `Narrative Fallacy: When we see a sequence of facts we interpret them as a story by threading them together into an imagined chain of cause & effect. If a drug addict commits suicide we assume the drug habit led to the suicide, even if it didn’t.`
https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1225561131122597896.html `Nirvana Fallacy: When people reject a thing because it compares unfavorably to an ideal that in reality is unattainable. E.g. condemning capitalism due to the superiority of imagined socialism, condemning ruthlessness in war due to imagining humane (but unrealistic) ways to win.`
https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1225561131122597896.html `Outgroup Homogeneity Effect: We tend to view outgroup members as all the same e.g. believing all Trump supporters would see someone wearing a MAGA cap, and think that person is also decent, honest, hard-working, etc.`
https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1225561131122597896.html `Pareidolia: For aeons predators stalked us in undergrowth & shadow. In such times survival favored the paranoid—those who could discern a wolf from the vaguest of outlines. This paranoia preserved our species, but cursed us with pareidolia, so we now see wolves even in the skies.`
https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1225561131122597896.html `Pareto Principle: Pattern of nature in which ~80% of effects result from ~20% of causes. E.g. 80% of wealth is held by 20% of people, 80% of computer errors result from 20% of bugs, 80% of crimes are committed by 20% of criminals, 80% of box office revenue comes from 20% of films.`
https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1225561131122597896.html `Peter Principle: People in a hierarchy such as a business or government will be promoted until they suck at their jobs, at which point they will remain where they are. As a result, the world is filled with people who suck at their jobs.`
https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1225561131122597896.html `Pluralistic Ignorance: Phenomenon where a group goes along with a norm, even though all of the group members secretly hate it, because each mistakenly believes that the others approve of it. (See also: Abilene Paradox).`
https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1225561131122597896.html `Predictive Coding: There is no actual movement on a TV screen; your brain invents it. There are no actual spaces between spoken words; your brain inserts them. Human perception is like predictive text, replacing the unknown with the expected.`
https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1225561131122597896.html `Radical Phase Transition (my term): Extremist movements can behave like solids (tyrannies), liquids (insurgencies), and gases (conspiracy theories). Pressuring them causes them to go from solid => liquid => gas. Leaving them alone causes them to go from gas => liquid => solid.`
https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1225561131122597896.html `Reactance Theory: When someone is restricted from expressing a POV, or pressured to adopt a different POV, they usually react by believing their original POV even more. For a detailed example read my piece on my attempt to deradicalize a neo-Nazi: https://areomagazine.com/2017/10/28/how-not-to-de-radicalize-a-twitter-neo-nazi/.`
https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1225561131122597896.html `Shifting Baseline Syndrome: Frog says to Fish, "how’s the water?". Fish replies, "what’s water?". We become blind to what we’re familiar with. And since the world is always changing, and we're always getting used to it, we can even become blind to the slow march of catastrophe.`
https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1225561131122597896.html `Simpson’s Paradox: A trend can appear in groups of data but disappear when these groups are combined. This effect can easily be exploited by limiting a dataset so that it shows exactly what one wants it to show. Thus: beware of even the strongest correlations.`
https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1225561131122597896.html `Streetlight Effect: People tend to get their information from where it’s easiest to look. E.g. the majority of research uses only the sources that appear on the first page of Google search results, regardless of how factual they are. Cumulatively, this can skew an entire field.`
https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1225561131122597896.html `Subselves: We use different mental processes in different situations, so each of us is not a single character but a collection of different characters, who take turns to commandeer the body depending on the situation. There is an office "you", a lover "you", an online "you", etc.`
https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1225561131122597896.html `Survivorship Bias: We overemphasize the examples that pass a visibility threshold e.g. our understanding of serial killers is based on the ones who got caught. Equally, news is only news if it’s an exception rather than the rule, but since it’s what we see we treat it as the rule.`
https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1225561131122597896.html `The Petrie Multiplier: In fields in which men outnumber women, such as in STEM, women receive an underestimated amount of harassment due to the fact that there are more potential givers than receivers of harassment. (See also: Lotka-Volterra equations).`
https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1225561131122597896.html `Tocqueville Paradox: As the living standards in a society rise, the people’s expectations of the society rise with it. The rise in expectations eventually surpasses the rise in living standards, inevitably resulting in disaffection (and sometimes populist uprisings).`
https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1225561131122597896.html `Ultimate Attribution Error: We tend to attribute good acts by allies to their character, and bad acts by allies to situational factors. For opponents, it’s reversed: good acts are attributed to situational factors, and bad acts to character.`
https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1225561131122597896.html `Woozle Effect: An article makes a claim without evidence, is then cited by another, which is cited by another, and so on, until the range of citations creates the impression that the claim has evidence, when really all articles are citing the same uncorroborated source.`

https://www.buzzfeed.com/michelleno/effective-psychological-tricks `I currently manage around 240 people between six restaurants. It is often hard to get them to do what is needed. I have found that saying "I need your help" is effective in getting them on board. People want to feel needed and like that they are making a difference.`
https://www.buzzfeed.com/michelleno/effective-psychological-tricks `I work in an office. When people stop by my desk and refuse to leave me alone, I get up and refill my water bottle while they are talking to me. Instead of walking back to my desk, I walk them to theirs. They instinctively will sit down. Then I just sever the conversation and get back to work.`
https://www.buzzfeed.com/michelleno/effective-psychological-tricks `I work in emergency services. If someone is totally distraught and shut down, asking their phone number, address, social security number, or birth date can pull them out of an emotional place and bring them back to a headspace where they can talk about what happened more easily. I often ask these questions even after I have the information, just to deescalate.`
https://www.buzzfeed.com/michelleno/effective-psychological-tricks `I work with a bunch of idiot lawyers and I use the phrase "You’re correct" all the time. Even if it’s one teeny tiny thing they’re correct about, it makes them feel smart and they instantly soften. It also keeps them listening because they’re hoping more flattery will come down the pike.`
https://www.buzzfeed.com/michelleno/effective-psychological-tricks `If they are screaming and yelling, you need to come in loud — while not attacking them, and agreeing with them (to a point). By agreeing with their anger, they are more open to listen to you. Works pretty much every time, though there might be a little up and down in the middle. Just follow the person's lead while always being a level below them.`

https://www.buzzfeed.com/michelleno/effective-psychological-tricks `Instead of asking "Do you have any questions?". I ask "What questions do you have?". The first almost always results in silence, while the second helps people feel comfortable asking questions.`

If you can get them to laugh, it sets them in a mood where they are unlikely to bluff.`

https://www.buzzfeed.com/michelleno/effective-psychological-tricks `My 4-year-old got into the "why?" phase a little while back. I read an article that said the best way to get them to stop was to ask them "I'm not sure, what do you think?" It is a godsend.`

https://www.buzzfeed.com/michelleno/effective-psychological-tricks `To de-escalate a situation or someone who is prone to violence, address them at one or two emotional levels below where they are. For example, If their anger is at a level 10, then you should come in at a level 8. Being completely calm, reserved, and polite only pisses people off more as you "clearly don't understand the magnitude of the situation.".`

https://www.buzzfeed.com/michelleno/effective-psychological-tricks `When I do something bothersome to my husband and he goes quiet, I wait a few minutes and then ask him a seemingly innocent question, usually on the subject of how certain parts of a car works. This gets him talking about the car thing and he rambles for like five minutes and then, Bam! He’s happy again and not quietly brooding.`
